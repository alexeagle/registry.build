Please remove the `use_extension()` and `use_repo()` calls that were previously necessary.\r\n\r\nFor users embedding Python, please replace the `pybind11_embed` target with `@rules_python//python/cc:current_py_cc_libs`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Move to rules_python and remove local_config_python. by @junyer in
