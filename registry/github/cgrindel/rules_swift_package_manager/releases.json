Changes ⚠️ \r\n\r\n- Swift package manager products are now represented by a single `swift_library_group` Bazel target. Previously, a product was represented by one or more Bazel targets.\r\n- The Bazel targets generated for Swift packages are much shorter. Previously, the Bazel target labels were derived from an SPM target's path and name. Now, Bazel targets for SPM targets are `<target name>.rspm` and for SPM products is `<product name>`.\r\n\r\nWhen you upgrade to this release, be sure to run `//:swift_update_pkgs` and `//:update_build_files`. If you do not use the Gazelle plugin to manage your build files, you will need to manually update the Swift package dependencies in your project.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or run into any issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cgrindel/rules_swift_package_manager/issues/new/choose).\r\n\r\n## Bazel Module Snippet\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbazel_dep(name =
