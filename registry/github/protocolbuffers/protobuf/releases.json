Announcements\r\n* This release fixes **CVE-2024-2410** (note: there may be a delay in the publication of this CVE number), a minor vulnerability in the C++ JSON parser. In certain situations, a malicious JSON input could cause the parser to copy data that has already been freed into an error message. This can only happen if the code is parsing from a stream with separate chunks rather than a contiguous array. The bug was introduced in 4.22.0 and was fixed with b955165ebdcc5a8ba9c267230d6305f4e3d9c118 in 4.25.0 and up.\r\n* [Protobuf News](https://protobuf.dev/news/) may include additional announcements or pre-announcements for upcoming changes.\r\n\r\n# Compiler\r\n* Implement proto2/proto3 with editions (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/3813b6622f6490b969c16e1b1ba7dcbd8f4e3209)\r\n* Defines Protobuf compiler version strings as macros and separates out suffix string definition.
