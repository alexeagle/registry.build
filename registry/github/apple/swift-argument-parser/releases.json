(#496)\r\n- Default values are now supported for `@Argument` or `@Option` properties with optional type, allowing you to initialize those properties with `nil`. Providing a non-`nil` default value results in a warning, since optional properties with non-`nil` defaults don't need to be declared as optionals. (#477, #480)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- The `.unconditionalRemaining` array parsing strategy has been deprecated and renamed to `.captureForPassthrough`, to better fit its semantic behavior and intended usage. See the [`ArgumentArrayParsingStrategy` documentation][arrayparse-docs] for more. (#496)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Invalid `init(from:)` decoding initializers are now correctly diagnosed by ArgumentParser's validators. (#487)\r\n- Default values are now correctly displayed as flags for `@Flag` properties with inversions or `EnumerableFlag` types. (#486)\r\n- The help display for non-string-backed raw representable types has been corrected to not show raw Swift values. Instead, the help display uses the type's customized `defaultValueDescription` and `allValues` implementations. (#494)\r\n- Properties at different levels of a command hierarchy with the same Swift name but different argument names no longer collide.

This allows `ParsableCommand` types to be designated as the entry\r\n  point for a Swift executable by using the `@main` attribute.\r\n  \r\n  *Migration:* For most uses, this change is source compatible. If you have\r\n  used `main()` where a `() -> Never` function is explicitly required, you'll\r\n  need to change your usage or capture the method in another function.\r\n\r\n- `Optional` no longer conforms to `ExpressibleByArgument`, to avoid some\r\n  property declarations that don't make sense. \r\n\r\n  *Migration:* This is source-compatible for all property declarations, with\r\n  deprecations for optional properties that define an explicit default. If\r\n  you're using optional values where an `ExpressibleByArgument` type is\r\n  expected, such as a generic function, you will need to change your usage\r\n  or provide an explicit override.\r\n\r\n- `ParsableCommand`'s `run()` method requirement is now a `mutating` method,\r\n  allowing mutations to a command's properties, such as sorting an array of\r\n  arguments, without additional copying.\r\n  \r\n  *Migration:* No changes are required for commands that are executed through\r\n  the `main()` method. If you manually parse a command and then call its\r\n  `run()` method, you may need to change the command from a constant to a\r\n  variable.\r\n\r\n### Removals\r\n\r\n- The `@Flag` initializers that were deprecated in version 0.0.6 are now\r\n  marked as unavailable.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- `@Option` properties of an optional type that use a `transform` closure now\r\n  correctly indicate their optionality in the usage string.\r\n- Correct wrapping and indentation are maintained for abstracts and discussions \r\n  with short lines.\r\n- Empty abstracts no longer add extra blank lines to the help screen.\r\n- Help requests are still honored even when a parsed command fails validation.\r\n- The `--` terminator isn't consumed when parsing a command, so that it can be\r\n  parsed as a value when a subcommand includes an `.unconditionalRemaining`\r\n  argument array.\r\n- CMake builds work correctly again.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apple/swift-argument-parser/releases/26526000","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apple/swift-argument-parser/releases/26526000/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/apple/swift-argument-parser/releases/26526000/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser/releases/tag/0.0.6","id":26526000,"author":{"login":"natecook1000","id":7053374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTMzNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7053374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000","html_url":"https://github.com/natecook1000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natecook1000/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI2NTI2MDAw","tag_name":"0.0.6","target_commitish":"master","name":"ArgumentParser 0.0.6","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-05-14T17:55:32Z","published_at":"2020-05-14T17:57:02Z","assets":[],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apple/swift-argument-parser/tarball/0.0.6","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apple/swift-argument-parser/zipball/0.0.6","body":"### Additions\r\n\r\n- Command definition validation now checks for name collisions between options\r\n  and flags.\r\n- `ValidationError.message` is now publicly accessible.\r\n- Added an `EnumerableFlag` protocol for `CaseIterable` types that are used to\r\n  provide the names for flags.
