The more serious bug caused a program linked with\r\n      liblzma to crash on start up if the flag -fprofile-generate was\r\n      used to build liblzma. The second bug caused liblzma to falsely\r\n      report an invalid write to Valgrind when loading liblzma.\r\n\r\n    * xz: Changed the messages for thread reduction due to memory\r\n      constraints to only appear under the highest verbosity level.\r\n\r\n    * Build:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed a build issue when the header file <linux/landlock.h>\r\n          was present on the system but the Landlock system calls were\r\n          not defined in <sys/syscall.h>.\r\n\r\n        - The CMake build now warns and disables NLS if both gettext\r\n          tools and pre-created .gmo files are missing. Previously,\r\n          this caused the CMake build to fail.\r\n\r\n    * Minor improvements to man pages.\r\n\r\n    * Minor improvements to

currently are no plans to maintain the 5.4.x branch, but releases\r\ncould be made if there is community interest.\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from the NEWS file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n5.6.0 (2024-02-24)\r\n\r\n    This bumps the minor version of liblzma because new features were\r\n    added. The API and ABI are still backward compatible with liblzma\r\n    5.4.x and 5.2.x and 5.0.x.\r\n\r\n    NOTE: As described in the NEWS for 5.5.2beta, the core components\r\n    are now under the BSD Zero Clause License (0BSD).\r\n\r\n    Since 5.5.2beta:\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Disabled the branchless C variant in the LZMA decoder based\r\n          on the benchmark results from the community.\r\n\r\n        - Disabled x86-64 inline assembly on x32 to fix the build.\r\n\r\n    * Sandboxing support in xz:\r\n\r\n        - Landlock is now used even when xz needs to create files.\r\n          In this case the sandbox is has to be more permissive than\r\n          when no files need to be created. A similar thing was\r\n          already in use with pledge(2) since 5.3.4alpha.\r\n\r\n        - Landlock and pledge(2) are now stricter when reading from\r\n          more than one input file and only writing to standard output.\r\n\r\n        - Added support for Landlock ABI version 4.\r\n\r\n    * CMake:\r\n\r\n        - Default to -O2 instead of -O3 with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.\r\n          -O3 is not useful for speed and makes the code larger.\r\n\r\n        - Now builds lzmainfo and lzmadec.\r\n\r\n        - xzdiff, xzgrep, xzless, xzmore, and their symlinks are now\r\n          installed. The scripts are also tested during \"make test\".\r\n\r\n        - Added translation support for xz, lzmainfo, and the\r\n          man pages.\r\n\r\n        - Applied the symbol versioning workaround for MicroBlaze that\r\n          is used in the Autotools build.\r\n\r\n        - The general XZ Utils and liblzma API documentation is now\r\n          installed.\r\n\r\n        - The CMake component names were changed a little and several\r\n          were added. liblzma_Runtime and liblzma_Development are\r\n          unchanged.\r\n\r\n        - Minimum required CMake version is now 3.14. However,\r\n          translation support is disabled with CMake versions\r\n          older than 3.20.\r\n\r\n        - The CMake-based build is now close to feature parity with the\r\n          Autotools-based build. Most importantly a few tests aren't\r\n          run yet. Testing the CMake-based build on different operating\r\n          systems would be welcome now. See the comment at the top of\r\n          CMakeLists.txt.\r\n\r\n    * Fixed a bug in the Autotools feature test for ARM64 CRC32\r\n      instruction support for old versions of Clang. This did not\r\n      affect the CMake build.\r\n\r\n    * Windows:\r\n\r\n        - The build instructions in INSTALL and windows/INSTALL*.txt\r\n          were revised completely.\r\n\r\n        - windows/build-with-cmake.bat along with the instructions\r\n          in windows/INSTALL-MinGW-w64_with_CMake.txt should make\r\n          it very easy to build liblzma.dll and xz.exe on Windows\r\n          using CMake and MinGW-w64 with either GCC or Clang/LLVM.\r\n\r\n        - windows/build.bash was updated. It now works on MSYS2 and\r\n          on GNU/Linux (cross-compiling) to create a .zip and .7z\r\n          package for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 using GCC + MinGW-w64.\r\n\r\n    * The TODO file is no longer installed as part of the\r\n      documentation. The file is out of date and does not reflect\r\n      the actual tasks that will be completed in the future.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Translated lzmainfo man pages are now installed. These\r\n          had been forgotten in earlier versions.\r\n\r\n        - Updated Croatian, Esperanto, German, Hungarian, Korean,\r\n          Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Vietnamese, and Ukrainian\r\n          translations.\r\n\r\n        - Updated German, Korean, Romanian, and Ukrainian man page\r\n          translations.\r\n\r\n    * Added a few tests.\r\n

is the first release made under the 0BSD license. Please let us\r\nknow if there are any concerns about the license change. We are looking\r\nforward to releasing 5.6.0 later this month!\r\n\r\n```\r\n5.5.2beta (2024-02-14)\r\n\r\n    * Licensing change: The core components are now under the\r\n      BSD Zero Clause License (0BSD). In XZ Utils 5.4.6 and older\r\n      and 5.5.1alpha these components are in the public domain and\r\n      obviously remain so; the change affects the new releases only.\r\n\r\n      0BSD is an extremely permissive license which doesn't require\r\n      retaining or reproducing copyright or license notices when\r\n      distributing the code, thus in practice there is extremely\r\n      little difference to public domain.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma\r\n\r\n        - Significant speed optimizations to the LZMA decoder were\r\n          made. There are now three variants that can be chosen at\r\n          build time:\r\n\r\n            * Basic C version: This is a few percent faster than\r\n              5.4.x due to some new optimizations.\r\n\r\n            * Branchless C: This is currently the default on platforms\r\n              for which there is no assembly code. This should be a few\r\n              percent faster than the basic C version.\r\n\r\n            * x86-64 inline assembly. This works with GCC and Clang.\r\n\r\n          The default choice can currently be overriden by setting\r\n          LZMA_RANGE_DECODER_CONFIG in CPPFLAGS: 0 means the basic\r\n          version and 3 means that branchless C version.\r\n\r\n        - Optimized the CRC32 calculation on ARM64 platforms using the\r\n          CRC32 instructions. The instructions are optional in ARMv8.0\r\n          and are required in ARMv8.1 and later. Runtime detection for\r\n          the instruction is used on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and\r\n          macOS. If the compiler flags indicate unconditional CRC32\r\n          instruction support (+crc) then the generic version is not\r\n          built.\r\n\r\n    * Added lz4 support to xzdiff/xzcmp and xzgrep.\r\n\r\n    * Man pages of xzdiff/xzcmp, xzgrep, and xzmore were rewritten\r\n      to simplify licensing of the man page translations.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated Chinese (simplified), German, Korean, Polish,\r\n          Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian translations.\r\n\r\n        - Updated German, Korean, Romanian, and Ukrainian man page\r\n          translations.\r\n\r\n    * Small improvements to the tests.\r\n\r\n    * Added doc/examples/11_file_info.c. It was added to the Git\r\n      repository in 2017 but forgotten to be added into distribution\r\n      tarballs.\r\n\r\n    * Removed doc/examples_old. These were from 2012.\r\n\r\n    * Removed the macos/build.sh script. It had not been updated\r\n      since 2013.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/142029062/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/138654499","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/138654499/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/138654499/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.5.1alpha","id":138654499,"author":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4IQ7Mj","tag_name":"v5.5.1alpha","target_commitish":"master","name":"XZ

is an extract from the NEWS file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n5.5.1alpha (2024-01-26)\r\n\r\n    * Added a new filter for RISC-V binaries. The filter can be used\r\n      for 32-bit and 64-bit binaries with either little or big\r\n      endianness. In liblzma, the Filter ID is LZMA_FILTER_RISCV (0x0B)\r\n      and the xz option is --riscv. liblzma filter string syntax\r\n      recognizes this filter as \"riscv\".\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_mt_block_size() to recommend a Block size for\r\n          multithreaded encoding\r\n\r\n        - Added CLMUL-based CRC32 on x86-64 and E2K with runtime\r\n          processor detection. Similar to CRC64, on 32-bit x86 it\r\n          isn't available unless --disable-assembler is used.\r\n\r\n        - Implemented GNU indirect function (IFUNC) as a runtime\r\n          function dispatching method for CRC32 and CRC64 fast\r\n          implementations on x86. Only GNU/Linux (glibc) and FreeBSD\r\n          builds will use IFUNC, unless --enable-ifunc is specified to\r\n          configure.\r\n\r\n        - Added definitions of mask values like\r\n          LZMA_INDEX_CHECK_MASK_CRC32 to <lzma/index.h>.\r\n\r\n        - The XZ logo is now included in the Doxygen generated\r\n          documentation. It is licensed under Creative Commons\r\n          Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0.\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Multithreaded mode is now the default. This improves\r\n          compression speed and creates .xz files that can be\r\n          decompressed multithreaded at the cost of increased memory\r\n          usage and slightly worse compression ratio.\r\n\r\n        - Added new command line option --filters to set the filter\r\n          chain using liblzma filter string syntax.\r\n\r\n        - Added new command line options --filters1 ... --filters9 to\r\n          set additional filter chains using liblzma filter string\r\n          syntax. The --block-list option now allows specifying filter\r\n          chains that were set using these new options.\r\n\r\n        - Added support for Linux Landlock as a sandboxing method.\r\n\r\n        - xzdec now supports pledge(2), Capsicum, and Linux Landlock as\r\n          sandboxing methods.\r\n\r\n        - Progress indicator time stats remain accurate after pausing\r\n          xz with SIGTSTP.\r\n\r\n        - Ported xz and xzdec to Windows MSVC. Visual Studio 2015 or\r\n          later is required.\r\n\r\n    * CMake Build:\r\n\r\n        - Supports pledge(2), Capsicum, and Linux Landlock sandboxing\r\n          methods.\r\n\r\n        - Replacement functions for getopt_long() are used on platforms\r\n          that do not have it.\r\n\r\n    * Enabled unaligned access by default on PowerPC64LE and on RISC-V\r\n      targets that define __riscv_misaligned_fast.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Added two new fuzz targets to OSS-Fuzz.\r\n\r\n        - Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) testing using\r\n          GitHub

is an extract from the NEWS file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n5.4.5 (2023-11-01)\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Use __attribute__((__no_sanitize_address__)) to avoid address\r\n          sanitization with CRC64 CLMUL. It uses 16-byte-aligned reads\r\n          which can extend past the bounds of the input buffer and\r\n          inherently trigger address sanitization errors. This isn't\r\n          a bug.\r\n\r\n        - Fixed an assertion failure that could be triggered by a large\r\n          unpadded_size argument. It was verified that there was no\r\n          other bug than the assertion failure.\r\n\r\n        - Fixed a bug that prevented building with Windows Vista\r\n          threading when __attribute__((__constructor__)) is not\r\n          supported.\r\n\r\n    * xz now properly handles special files such as \"con\" or \"nul\" on\r\n      Windows. Before this fix, the following wrote \"foo\" to the\r\n      console and deleted the input file \"con_xz\":\r\n\r\n          echo foo | xz > con_xz\r\n          xz --suffix=_xz --decompress con_xz\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - Allow builds with Windows win95 threading and small mode when\r\n          __attribute__((__constructor__)) is supported.\r\n\r\n        - Added a new line to liblzma.pc for MSYS2 (Windows):\r\n\r\n              Cflags.private: -DLZMA_API_STATIC\r\n\r\n          When compiling code that will link against static liblzma,\r\n          the LZMA_API_STATIC macro needs to be defined on Windows.\r\n\r\n        - CMake specific changes:\r\n\r\n            * Fixed a bug that allowed CLOCK_MONOTONIC to be used even\r\n              if the check for it failed.\r\n\r\n            * Fixed a bug where configuring CMake multiple times\r\n              resulted in HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME and HAVE_CLOCK_MONOTONIC\r\n              not being set.\r\n\r\n            * Fixed the build with MinGW-w64-based Clang/LLVM 17.\r\n              llvm-windres now has more accurate GNU windres emulation\r\n              so the GNU windres workaround from 5.4.1 is needed with\r\n              llvm-windres version 17 too.\r\n\r\n            * The import library on Windows is now properly named\r\n              \"liblzma.dll.a\" instead of \"libliblzma.dll.a\"\r\n\r\n            * Fixed a bug causing the Ninja Generator to fail on\r\n              UNIX-like systems. This bug was introduced in 5.4.0.\r\n\r\n            * Added a new option to disable CLMUL CRC64.\r\n\r\n            * A module-definition (.def) file is now created when\r\n              building liblzma.dll with MinGW-w64.\r\n\r\n            * The pkg-config liblzma.pc file is now installed on all\r\n              builds except when using MSVC on Windows.\r\n\r\n            * Added large file support by default for platforms that\r\n              need it to handle files larger than 2 GiB. This includes\r\n              MinGW-w64, even 64-bit builds.\r\n\r\n    * Small fixes and improvements to the tests.\r\n\r\n    * Updated translations: Chinese (simplified) and

 * liblzma and xzdec can now build against WASI SDK when threading\r\n      support is disabled. xz and tests don't build yet.\r\n\r\n    * CMake:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed a bug preventing other projects from including liblzma\r\n          multiple times using find_package().\r\n\r\n        - Don't create broken symlinks in Cygwin and MSYS2 unless\r\n          supported by the environment. This prevented building for the\r\n          default MSYS2 environment. The problem was introduced in\r\n          xz 5.4.0.\r\n\r\n    * Documentation:\r\n\r\n        - Small improvements to man pages.\r\n\r\n        - Small improvements and typo fixes for liblzma API\r\n          documentation.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Added a new section to INSTALL to describe basic test usage\r\n          and address recent questions about building the tests when\r\n          cross compiling.\r\n\r\n        - Small fixes and improvements to the tests.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed a mistake that caused one of the error messages to not\r\n          be translated. This only affected versions 5.4.2 and 5.4.3.\r\n\r\n        - Updated the Chinese (simplified), Croatian, Esperanto, German,\r\n          Korean, Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and\r\n          Vietnamese translations.\r\n\r\n        - Updated the German, Korean, Romanian, and Ukrainian man page\r\n

Doxygen-generated liblzma API are now available online at\r\n<https://tukaani.org/xz/liblzma-api/files.html>.\r\n\r\n5.4.2 (2023-03-18)\r\n\r\n    * All fixes from 5.2.11 that were not included in 5.4.1.\r\n\r\n    * If xz is built with support for the Capsicum sandbox but running\r\n      in an environment that doesn't support Capsicum, xz now runs\r\n      normally without sandboxing instead of exiting with an error.\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Documentation was updated to improve the style, consistency,\r\n          and completeness of the liblzma API headers.\r\n\r\n        - The Doxygen-generated HTML documentation for the liblzma API\r\n          header files is now included in the source release and is\r\n          installed as part of \"make install\". All JavaScript is\r\n          removed to simplify license compliance and to reduce the\r\n          install size.\r\n\r\n        - Fixed a minor bug in lzma_str_from_filters() that produced\r\n          too many filters in the output string instead of reporting\r\n          an error if the input array had more than four filters. This\r\n          bug did not affect xz.\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - autogen.sh now invokes the doxygen tool via the new wrapper\r\n          script doxygen/update-doxygen, unless the command line option\r\n          --no-doxygen is used.\r\n\r\n        - Added microlzma_encoder.c and microlzma_decoder.c to the\r\n          VS project files for Windows and to the CMake build. These\r\n          should have been included in 5.3.2alpha.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Added a test to the CMake build that was forgotten in the\r\n          previous release.\r\n\r\n        - Added and refactored a few tests.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated the Brazilian Portuguese translation.\r\n\r\n        - Added Brazilian Portuguese man page

(2023-01-11)\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed the return value of lzma_microlzma_encoder() if the\r\n          LZMA options lc/lp/pb are invalid. Invalid lc/lp/pb options\r\n          made the function return LZMA_STREAM_END without encoding\r\n          anything instead of returning LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR.\r\n\r\n        - Windows / Visual Studio: Workaround a possible compiler bug\r\n          when targeting 32-bit x86 and compiling the CLMUL version of\r\n          the CRC64 code. The CLMUL code isn't enabled by the Windows\r\n          project files but it is in the CMake-based builds.\r\n\r\n    * Build systems:\r\n\r\n        - Windows-specific CMake changes:\r\n\r\n            * Don't try to enable CLMUL CRC64 code if _mm_set_epi64x()\r\n              isn't available. This fixes CMake-based build with Visual\r\n              Studio 2013.\r\n\r\n            * Created a workaround for a build failure with windres\r\n              from GNU binutils. It is used only when the C compiler\r\n              is GCC (not Clang). The workaround is incompatible\r\n              with llvm-windres, resulting in \"XZx20Utils\" instead\r\n              of \"XZ Utils\" in the resource file, but without the\r\n              workaround llvm-windres works correctly. See the\r\n              comment in CMakeLists.txt for details.\r\n\r\n            * Included the resource files in the xz and xzdec build\r\n              rules. Building the command line tools is still\r\n              experimental but possible with MinGW-w64.\r\n\r\n        - Visual Studio: Added stream_decoder_mt.c to the project\r\n          files. Now the threaded decompressor lzma_stream_decoder_mt()\r\n          gets built. CMake-based build wasn't affected.\r\n\r\n        - Updated windows/INSTALL-MSVC.txt to mention that CMake-based\r\n          build is now the preferred method with Visual Studio. The\r\n          project files will probably be removed after 5.4.x releases.\r\n\r\n        - Changes to #defines in config.h:\r\n\r\n            * HAVE_DECL_CLOCK_MONOTONIC was replaced by\r\n              HAVE_CLOCK_MONOTONIC. The old macro was always defined\r\n              in configure-generated config.h to either 0 or 1. The\r\n              new macro is defined (to 1) only if the declaration of\r\n              CLOCK_MONOTONIC is available. This matches the way most\r\n              other config.h macros work and makes things simpler with\r\n              other build systems.\r\n\r\n            * HAVE_DECL_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME was replaced by\r\n              HAVE_PROGRAM_INVOCATION_NAME for the same reason.\r\n\r\n    * Tests:\r\n\r\n        - Fixed test script compatibility with ancient /bin/sh\r\n          versions. Now the five test_compress_* tests should\r\n          no longer fail on Solaris 10.\r\n\r\n        - Added and refactored a few tests.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated the Catalan

(2022-12-13)\r\n\r\n    This bumps the minor version of liblzma because new features were\r\n    added. The API and ABI are still backward compatible with liblzma\r\n    5.2.x and 5.0.x.\r\n\r\n    Since 5.3.5beta:\r\n\r\n    * All fixes from 5.2.10.\r\n\r\n    * The ARM64 filter is now stable. The xz option is now --arm64.\r\n      Decompression requires XZ Utils 5.4.0. In the future the ARM64\r\n      filter will be supported by XZ for Java, XZ Embedded (including\r\n      the version in Linux), LZMA SDK, and 7-Zip.\r\n\r\n    * Translations:\r\n\r\n        - Updated Catalan, Croatian, German, Romanian, and Turkish\r\n          translations.\r\n\r\n        - Updated German man page translations.\r\n\r\n        - Added Romanian man page translations.\r\n\r\n    Summary of new features added in the 5.3.x development releases:\r\n\r\n    * liblzma:\r\n\r\n        - Added threaded .xz decompressor lzma_stream_decoder_mt().\r\n          It can use multiple threads with .xz files that have multiple\r\n          Blocks with size information in Block Headers. The threaded\r\n          encoder in xz has always created such files.\r\n\r\n          Single-threaded encoder cannot store the size information in\r\n          Block Headers even if one used LZMA_FULL_FLUSH to create\r\n          multiple Blocks, so this threaded decoder cannot use multiple\r\n          threads with such files.\r\n\r\n          If there are multiple Streams (concatenated .xz files), one\r\n          Stream will be decompressed completely before starting the\r\n          next Stream.\r\n\r\n        - A new decoder flag LZMA_FAIL_FAST was added. It makes the\r\n          threaded decompressor report errors soon instead of first\r\n          flushing all pending data before the error location.\r\n\r\n        - New Filter IDs:\r\n            * LZMA_FILTER_ARM64 is for ARM64 binaries.\r\n            * LZMA_FILTER_LZMA1EXT is for raw LZMA1 streams that don't\r\n              necessarily use the end marker.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_str_to_filters(), lzma_str_from_filters(), and\r\n          lzma_str_list_filters() to convert a preset or a filter chain\r\n          string to a lzma_filter[] and vice versa. These should make\r\n          it easier to write applications that allow users to specify\r\n          custom compression options.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_filters_free() which can be convenient for freeing\r\n          the filter options in a filter chain (an array of lzma_filter\r\n          structures).\r\n\r\n        - lzma_file_info_decoder() to makes it a little easier to get\r\n          the Index field from .xz files. This helps in getting the\r\n          uncompressed file size but an easy-to-use random access\r\n          API is still missing which has existed in XZ for Java for\r\n          a long time.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_microlzma_encoder() and lzma_microlzma_decoder().\r\n          It is used by erofs-utils and may be used by others too.\r\n\r\n          The MicroLZMA format is a raw LZMA stream (without end marker)\r\n          whose first byte (always 0x00) has been replaced with\r\n          bitwise-negation of the LZMA properties (lc/lp/pb). It was\r\n          created for use in EROFS but may be used in other contexts\r\n          as well where it is important to avoid wasting bytes for\r\n          stream headers or footers. The format is also supported by\r\n          XZ Embedded (the XZ Embedded version in Linux got MicroLZMA\r\n          support in Linux 5.16).\r\n\r\n          The MicroLZMA encoder API in liblzma can compress into a\r\n          fixed-sized output buffer so that as much data is compressed\r\n          as can be fit into the buffer while still creating a valid\r\n          MicroLZMA stream. This is needed for EROFS.\r\n\r\n        - Added lzma_lzip_decoder() to decompress the .lz (lzip) file\r\n          format version 0 and the original unextended version 1 files.\r\n          Also lzma_auto_decoder() supports .lz files.\r\n\r\n        - lzma_filters_update() can now be used with the multi-threaded\r\n          encoder (lzma_stream_encoder_mt()) to change the filter chain\r\n          after LZMA_FULL_BARRIER or LZMA_FULL_FLUSH.\r\n\r\n        - In lzma_options_lzma, allow nice_len = 2 and 3 with the match\r\n          finders that require at least 3 or 4. Now it is internally\r\n          rounded up if needed.\r\n\r\n        - CLMUL-based CRC64 on x86-64 and E2K with runtime processor\r\n          detection. On 32-bit x86 it currently isn't available unless\r\n          --disable-assembler is used which can make the non-CLMUL\r\n          CRC64 slower; this might be fixed in the future.\r\n\r\n        - Building with --disable-threads --enable-small\r\n          is now thread-safe if the compiler supports\r\n          __attribute__((__constructor__)).\r\n\r\n    * xz:\r\n\r\n        - Using -T0 (--threads=0) will now use multi-threaded encoder\r\n          even on a single-core system. This is to ensure that output\r\n          from the same xz binary is identical on both single-core and\r\n          multi-core systems.\r\n\r\n        - --threads=+1 or -T+1 is now a way to put xz into\r\n          multi-threaded mode while using only one worker thread.\r\n          The + is ignored if the number is not 1.\r\n\r\n        - A default soft memory usage limit is now used for compression\r\n          when -T0 is used and no explicit limit has been specified.\r\n          This soft limit is used to restrict the number of threads\r\n          but if the limit is exceeded with even one thread then xz\r\n          will continue with one thread using the multi-threaded\r\n          encoder and this limit is ignored. If the number of threads\r\n          is specified manually then no default limit will be used;\r\n          this affects only -T0.\r\n\r\n          This change helps on systems that have very many cores and\r\n          using all of them for xz makes no sense. Previously xz -T0\r\n          could run out of memory on such systems because it attempted\r\n          to reserve memory for too many threads.\r\n\r\n          This also helps with 32-bit builds which don't have a large\r\n          amount of address space that would be required for many\r\n          threads. The default soft limit for -T0 is at most 1400 MiB\r\n          on all 32-bit platforms.\r\n\r\n        - Previously a low value in --memlimit-compress wouldn't cause\r\n          xz to switch from multi-threaded mode to single-threaded mode\r\n          if the limit cannot otherwise be met; xz failed instead. Now\r\n          xz can switch to single-threaded mode and then, if needed,\r\n          scale down the LZMA2 dictionary size too just like it already\r\n          did when it was started in single-threaded mode.\r\n\r\n        - The option --no-adjust no longer prevents xz from scaling down\r\n          the number of threads as that doesn't affect the compressed\r\n          output (only performance). Now --no-adjust only prevents\r\n          adjustments that affect compressed output, that is, with\r\n          --no-adjust xz won't switch from multi-threaded mode to\r\n          single-threaded mode and won't scale down the LZMA2\r\n          dictionary size.\r\n\r\n        - Added a new option --memlimit-mt-decompress=LIMIT. This is\r\n          used to limit the number of decompressor threads (possibly\r\n          falling back to single-threaded mode) but it will never make\r\n          xz refuse to decompress a file. This has a system-specific\r\n          default value because without any limit xz could end up\r\n          allocating memory for the whole compressed input file, the\r\n          whole uncompressed output file, multiple thread-specific\r\n          decompressor instances and so on. Basically xz could\r\n          attempt to use an insane amount of memory even with fairly\r\n          common files. The system-specific default value is currently\r\n          the same as the one used for compression with -T0.\r\n\r\n          The new option works together with the existing option\r\n          --memlimit-decompress=LIMIT. The old option sets a hard limit\r\n          that must not be exceeded (xz will refuse to decompress)\r\n          while the new option only restricts the number of threads.\r\n          If the limit set with --memlimit-mt-decompress is greater\r\n          than the limit set with --memlimit-compress, then the latter\r\n          value is used also for --memlimit-mt-decompress.\r\n\r\n        - Added new information to the output of xz --info-memory and\r\n          new fields to the output of xz --robot --info-memory.\r\n\r\n        - In --lzma2=nice=NUMBER allow 2 and 3 with all match finders\r\n          now that liblzma handles it.\r\n\r\n        - Don't mention endianness for ARM and ARM-Thumb filters in\r\n          --long-help. The filters only work for little endian\r\n          instruction encoding but modern ARM processors using\r\n          big endian data access still use little endian\r\n          instruction encoding. So the help text was misleading.\r\n          In contrast, the PowerPC filter is only for big endian\r\n          32/64-bit PowerPC code. Little endian PowerPC would need\r\n          a separate filter.\r\n\r\n        - Added decompression support for the .lz (lzip) file format\r\n          version 0 and the original unextended version 1. It is\r\n          autodetected by default. See also the option --format on\r\n          the xz man page.\r\n\r\n        - Sandboxing enabled by default:\r\n            * Capsicum (FreeBSD)\r\n            * pledge(2) (OpenBSD)\r\n\r\n    * Scripts now support the .lz format using xz.\r\n\r\n    * A few new tests were added.\r\n\r\n    * The liblzma-specific tests are now supported in CMake-based\r\n      builds too (\"make test\")."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/tukaani-project/xz/releases/85934693/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/releases/tag/v5.2.10","id":85934693,"author":{"login":"JiaT75","id":78042786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQyNzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78042786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaT75","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaT75/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOIQBEvs4FH0Jl","tag_name":"v5.2.10","target_commitish":"master","name":"5.2.10
