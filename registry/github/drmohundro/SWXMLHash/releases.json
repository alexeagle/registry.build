So, multiple values. Then, there is a new protocol named `XMLValueDeserialization` - it serves the purpose of both `XMLElementDeserializable` and `XMLAttributeDeserializable`. It is only used for custom value deserialization. I hope this will clarify the usage a lot. It makes sense to me anyway!\r\n\r\nThis should cover the use case at <https://github.com/drmohundro/SWXMLHash/discussions/148>.\r\n\r\n## Usability of Errors\r\n\r\nMultiple times when helping people, I'd notice that the `nodeIsInvalid` error would get thrown, but the error message was just about impossible to determine what was wrong. The code had implemented `CustomStringConvertible` but everyone was using `localizedDescription`. Now, errors implement `LocalizedError`, too, so it is a lot more obvious to see the elements that had caused issues.\r\n\r\n## Code Reorganization\r\n\r\nThe code had all been lumped into two Swift files since the beginning. It was unwieldy then, but it has just gotten worse. So I gave in and broke them all out into their own files by type. _Much better_.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drmohundro/SWXMLHash/releases/66277403/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drmohundro/SWXMLHash/releases/19610229","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drmohundro/SWXMLHash/releases/19610229/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/drmohundro/SWXMLHash/releases/19610229/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/drmohundro/SWXMLHash/releases/tag/5.0.0","id":19610229,"author":{"login":"drmohundro","id":43072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro","html_url":"https://github.com/drmohundro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drmohundro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE5NjEwMjI5","tag_name":"5.0.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"Official/full
