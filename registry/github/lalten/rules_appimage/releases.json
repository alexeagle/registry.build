This fixes the `runfiles.bash` setup handling. `https://github.com/lalten/rules_appimage/pull/58)\r\n* The variables set in the appimage target's `env` attr are now available also when running the appimage without `bazel run` by re-exporting them in the AppRun entrypoint https://github.com/lalten/rules_appimage/pull/59\r\n* The `env` attr dict of the binary target is preserved and updated with the appimage target's `env` attr dict when possible.
