for Bazel 2.0 (and possibly some earlier releases, but it has only been tested with 2.0).\r\n\r\n- Obey best practices for rule naming: file and macro names for dependency loading have changed. You now have to use `load(\"//antlr:repositories.bzl\", \"rules_antlr_dependencies\")`\r\n- Switched to semantic versioning for dependency loading instead of integer versions: `rules_antlr_dependencies(\"4.7.2\")`\r\n- An ANTLR version is now required for dependency loading\r\n- Dependency loading for C++ and Python has been added. Constants are provided for the supported languages : `rules_antlr_dependencies(\"4.7.2\", CPP, PYTHON)`\r\n- C/C++ headers are automatically propagated\r\n- Switched to Stardoc for documentation\r\n"}]
