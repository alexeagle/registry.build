\r\n  \r\n  Switched to the internal floating point formatter for all decimal presentation formats. In particular this results in consistent rounding on all platforms and removing the `s[n]printf` fallback for decimal FP formatting.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Compile-time floating point formatting no longer requires the header-only mode. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/G37PTeG3b)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <array>\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  consteval auto compile_time_dtoa(double value) -> std::array<char, 10> {\r\n    auto result = std::array<char, 10>();\r\n    fmt::format_to(result.data(), FMT_COMPILE(\"{}\"), value);\r\n    return result;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  constexpr auto answer = compile_time_dtoa(0.42);\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  works with the default settings.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved the implementation of [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox), the algorithm used for the default floating-point formatting (#2713, #2750). Thanks [@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon)](https://github.com/jk-jeon).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::to_string` work with `__float128`. This uses the internal FP formatter and works even on system without `__float128` support in `[s]printf`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Disabled automatic `std::ostream` insertion operator (`operator<<`) discovery when `fmt/ostream.h` is included to prevent ODR violations. You can get the old behavior by defining `FMT_DEPRECATED_OSTREAM` but this will be removed in the next major release. Use `fmt::streamed` or `fmt::ostream_formatter` to enable formatting via `std::ostream` instead.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `fmt::ostream_formatter` that can be used to write `formatter` specializations that perform formatting via `std::ostream`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5sEc5qMsf)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/ostream.h>\r\n  \r\n  struct date {\r\n    int year, month, day;\r\n  \r\n    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const date& d) {\r\n      return os << d.year << '-' << d.month << '-' << d.day;\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n  \r\n  template <> struct fmt::formatter<date> : ostream_formatter {};\r\n  \r\n  std::string s = fmt::format(\"The date is {}\", date{2012, 12, 9});\r\n  // s == \"The date is 2012-12-9\"\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added the `fmt::streamed` function that takes an object and formats it via `std::ostream`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5G3346G1f)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <thread>\r\n  #include <fmt/ostream.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"Current thread id: {}\\n\",\r\n               fmt::streamed(std::this_thread::get_id()));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Note that `fmt/std.h` provides a `formatter` specialization for `std::thread::id` so you don't need to format it via `std::ostream`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Deprecated implicit conversions of unscoped enums to integers for consistency with scoped enums.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added an argument-dependent lookup based `format_as` extension API to simplify formatting of enums.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added experimental `std::variant` formatting support (#2941). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/KG9z6cq68)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <variant>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto v = std::variant<int, std::string>(42);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", v);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  variant(42)\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@jehelset](https://github.com/jehelset).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added experimental `std::filesystem::path` formatting support (#2865, #2902, #2917, #2918). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/o44dMexEb)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <filesystem>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"There is no place like {}.\", std::filesystem::path(\"/home\"));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  There is no place like \"/home\".\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added a `std::thread::id` formatter to `fmt/std.h`. For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/j1azbYf3E)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <thread>\r\n  #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"Current thread id: {}\\n\", std::this_thread::get_id());\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added `fmt::styled` that applies a text style to an individual argument (#2793). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/vWGW7v5M6)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();\r\n    fmt::print(\r\n      \"[{}] {}: {}\\n\",\r\n      fmt::styled(now, fmt::emphasis::bold),\r\n      fmt::styled(\"error\", fg(fmt::color::red)),\r\n      \"something went wrong\");\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/175071215-12809244-dab0-4005-96d8-7cd911c964d5.png)\r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@rbrugo (Riccardo Brugo)](https://github.com/rbrugo).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made `fmt::print` overload for text styles correctly handle UTF-8 (#2681, #2701). Thanks [@AlexGuteniev (Alex Guteniev)](https://github.com/AlexGuteniev).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed Unicode handling when writing to an ostream.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for nested specifiers to range formatting (#2673). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/xd3Gj38cf)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <vector>\r\n  #include <fmt/ranges.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{::#x}\\n\", std::vector{10, 20, 30});\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  prints `[0xa, 0x14, 0x1e]`.\r\n  \r\n  Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Implemented escaping of wide strings in ranges (#2904). Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Added support for ranges with `begin` / `end` found via the argument-dependent lookup (#2807).

Thanks [@phprus (Vladislav Shchapov)](https://github.com/phprus).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the following deprecated APIs: `_format`, `arg_join`, the `format_to` overload that takes a memory buffer, `[v]fprintf` that takes an `ostream`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated implicit conversion of `[const] signed char*` and `[const] unsigned char*` to C strings.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed the deprecated `fmt/locale.h`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Replaced the deprecated `fileno()` with `descriptor()` in `buffered_file`.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Moved `to_string_view` to the `detail` namespace since it's an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made access mode of a created file consistent with `fopen` by setting `S_IWGRP` and `S_IWOTH` (#2733). Thanks [@arogge (Andreas Rogge)](https://github.com/arogge).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Removed a redundant buffer resize when formatting to `std::ostream` (#2842, #2843). Thanks [@jcelerier (Jean-Michaël Celerier)](https://github.com/jcelerier).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made precision computation for strings consistent with width (#2888).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Fixed handling of locale separators in floating point formatting (#2830).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Made sign specifiers work with `__int128_t` (#2773).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved support for systems such as CHERI with extra data stored in pointers (#2932). Thanks [@davidchisnall (David Chisnall)](https://github.com/davidchisnall).\r\n\r\n* \r\n  \r\n  Improved documentation (#2706, #2712, #2789, #2803, #2805, #2815, #2924).

This makes {fmt} up to 20-30x faster than common implementations of `std::ostringstream` and `sprintf` on [dtoa-benchmark](https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark) and faster than double-conversion and Ryū:![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/576385/95684665-11719600-0ba8-11eb-8e5b-972ff4e49428.png)It is possible to get even better performance at the cost of larger binary size by compiling with the `FMT_USE_FULL_CACHE_DRAGONBOX` macro set to 1. Thanks [@jk-jeon (Junekey Jeon)](https://github.com/jk-jeon).\r\n\r\n* Added an experimental unsynchronized file output API which, together with [format string compilation](https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#compile-api), can give [5-9 times speed up compared to fprintf](https://www.zverovich.net/2020/08/04/optimal-file-buffer-size.html) on common platforms ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/nsTcG8)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/os.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto f = fmt::output_file(\"guide\");\r\n    f.print(\"The answer is {}.\", 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* Added a formatter for `std::chrono::time_point<system_clock>` (#1819, #1837). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/c4M6fh)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();\r\n    fmt::print(\"The time is {:%H:%M:%S}.\\n\", now);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@adamburgess (Adam Burgess)](https://github.com/adamburgess).\r\n\r\n* Added support for ranges with non-const `begin`/`end` to `fmt::join` (#1784, #1786). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/jP63Tv)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/ranges.h>\r\n  #include <range/v3/view/filter.hpp>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    using std::literals::string_literals::operator\"\"s;\r\n    auto strs = std::array{\"a\"s, \"bb\"s, \"ccc\"s};\r\n    auto range = strs | ranges::views::filter(\r\n      [] (const std::string &x) { return x.size() != 2; }\r\n    );\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", fmt::join(range, \"\"));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  prints \"accc\". Thanks [@tonyelewis (Tony E Lewis)](https://github.com/tonyelewis).\r\n\r\n* Added a `memory_buffer::append` overload that takes a range (#1806). Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* Improved handling of single code units in `FMT_COMPILE`. For example:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  char* f(char* buf) {\r\n    return fmt::format_to(buf, FMT_COMPILE(\"x{}\"), 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  compiles to just ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/5vncz3)):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  _Z1fPc:\r\n    movb $120, (%rdi)\r\n    xorl %edx, %edx\r\n    cmpl $42, _ZN3fmt2v76detail10basic_dataIvE23zero_or_powers_of_10_32E+8(%rip)\r\n    movl $3, %eax\r\n    seta %dl\r\n    subl %edx, %eax\r\n    movzwl _ZN3fmt2v76detail10basic_dataIvE6digitsE+84(%rip), %edx\r\n    cltq\r\n    addq %rdi, %rax\r\n    movw %dx, -2(%rax)\r\n    ret\r\n  ```\r\n  Here a single `mov` instruction writes `'x'` (`$120`) to the output buffer.\r\n\r\n* Added dynamic width support to format string compilation (#1809).\r\n\r\n* Improved error reporting for unformattable types: now you'll get the type name directly in the error message instead of the note:\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  struct how_about_no {};\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\", how_about_no());\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Error ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/GoxM4e)): `fmt/core.h:1438:3: error: static_assert failed due to requirement 'fmt::v7::formattable<how_about_no>()' \"Cannot format an argument. To make type T formattable provide a formatter<T> specialization: https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#udt\" ...`\r\n\r\n* Added the [make_args_checked](https://fmt.dev/7.1.0/api.html#argument-lists) function template that allows you to write formatting functions with compile-time format string checks and avoid binary code bloat ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/PEf9qr)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  void vlog(const char* file, int line, fmt::string_view format,\r\n            fmt::format_args args) {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}: {}: \", file, line);\r\n    fmt::vprint(format, args);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  template <typename S, typename...

For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/93h86q)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/compile.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    char buffer[8];\r\n    fmt::format_to_n(buffer, sizeof(buffer), FMT_COMPILE(\"{}\"), 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@Kurkin (Dmitry Kurkin)](https://github.com/Kurkin), [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* Added `fmt::format_to` overload that take `text_style` (#1593, #1842, #1843). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/91153r)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    std::string out;\r\n    fmt::format_to(std::back_inserter(out),\r\n                   fmt::emphasis::bold | fg(fmt::color::red),\r\n                   \"The answer is {}.\", 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@Naios (Denis Blank)](https://github.com/Naios).\r\n\r\n* Made the `#` specifier emit trailing zeros in addition to the decimal point (#1797). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/bhdcW9)):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"{:#.2g}\", 0.5);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  prints `0.50`.\r\n\r\n* Changed the default floating point format to not include `.0` for consistency with `std::format` and `std::to_chars` (#1893, #1943). It is possible to get the decimal point and trailing zero with the `#` specifier.\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue with floating-point formatting that could result in addition of a non-significant trailing zero in rare cases e.g. `1.00e-34` instead of `1.0e-34` (#1873, #1917).\r\n\r\n* Made `fmt::to_string` fallback on `ostream` insertion operator if the `formatter` specialization is not provided (#1815, #1829). Thanks [@alexezeder (Alexey Ochapov)](https://github.com/alexezeder).\r\n\r\n* Added support for the append mode to the experimental file API and improved `fcntl.h` detection. (#1847, #1848). Thanks [@t-wiser](https://github.com/t-wiser).\r\n\r\n* Fixed handling of types that have both an implicit conversion operator and an overloaded `ostream` insertion operator (#1766).\r\n\r\n* Fixed a slicing issue in an internal iterator type (#1822). Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in locale-specific integer formatting (#1927).\r\n\r\n* Fixed handling of exotic code unit types (#1870, #1932).\r\n\r\n* Improved `FMT_ALWAYS_INLINE` (#1878).

This can be useful for extremely memory-constrained embedded systems (#1778, #1781). Thanks [@kammce (Khalil Estell)](https://github.com/kammce).\r\n\r\n* Added the `FMT_USE_INLINE_NAMESPACES` macro to control usage of inline namespaces (#1945).

For example, on macOS with clang the compile time of a test translation unit dropped from 2.3s to 0.3s with `-O2` and from 0.6s to 0.3s with the default settings (`-O0`).\r\n\r\n  Before (`-O2`):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2  2.22s user 0.08s system 99% cpu 2.311 total\r\n  ```\r\n  After (`-O2`):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17 -O2  0.26s user 0.04s system 98% cpu 0.303 total\r\n  ```\r\n  Before (default):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17  0.53s user 0.06s system 98% cpu 0.601 total\r\n  ```\r\n  After (default):\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  % time c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17\r\n  c++ -c test.cc -I include -std=c++17  0.24s user 0.06s system 98% cpu 0.301 total\r\n  ```\r\n  It is still recommended to use `fmt/core.h` instead of `fmt/format.h` but the compile time difference is now smaller. Thanks [@alex3d](https://github.com/alex3d) for the suggestion.\r\n\r\n* Named arguments are now stored on stack (no dynamic memory allocations) and the compiled code is more compact and efficient. For example\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/core.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(\"The answer is {answer}\\n\", fmt::arg(\"answer\", 42));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  compiles to just ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/NcfEp_))\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  .LC0:\r\n          .string \"answer\"\r\n  .LC1:\r\n          .string \"The answer is {answer}\\n\"\r\n  main:\r\n          sub     rsp, 56\r\n          mov     edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC1\r\n          mov     esi, 23\r\n          movabs  rdx, 4611686018427387905\r\n          lea     rax, [rsp+32]\r\n          lea     rcx, [rsp+16]\r\n          mov     QWORD PTR [rsp+8], 1\r\n          mov     QWORD PTR [rsp], rax\r\n          mov     DWORD PTR [rsp+16], 42\r\n          mov     QWORD PTR [rsp+32], OFFSET FLAT:.LC0\r\n          mov     DWORD PTR [rsp+40], 0\r\n          call    fmt::v6::vprint(fmt::v6::basic_string_view<char>,\r\n                                  fmt::v6::format_args)\r\n          xor     eax, eax\r\n          add     rsp, 56\r\n          ret\r\n  \r\n      .L.str.1:\r\n              .asciz  \"answer\"\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* Implemented compile-time checks for dynamic width and precision (#1614):\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/format.h>\r\n  \r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(FMT_STRING(\"{0:{1}}\"), 42);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  now gives a compilation error because argument 1 doesn't exist:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  In file included from test.cc:1:\r\n  include/fmt/format.h:2726:27: error: constexpr variable 'invalid_format' must be\r\n  initialized by a constant expression\r\n    FMT_CONSTEXPR_DECL bool invalid_format =\r\n                            ^\r\n  ...\r\n  include/fmt/core.h:569:26: note: in call to\r\n  '&checker(s, {}).context_->on_error(&\"argument not found\"[0])'\r\n      if (id >= num_args_) on_error(\"argument not found\");\r\n                          ^\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n* Added sentinel support to `fmt::join` (#1689)\r\n  \r\n  ```c++\r\n  struct zstring_sentinel {};\r\n  bool operator==(const char* p, zstring_sentinel) { return *p == '\\0'; }\r\n  bool operator!=(const char* p, zstring_sentinel) { return *p != '\\0'; }\r\n  \r\n  struct zstring {\r\n    const char* p;\r\n    const char* begin() const { return p; }\r\n    zstring_sentinel end() const { return {}; }\r\n  };\r\n  \r\n  auto s = fmt::format(\"{}\", fmt::join(zstring{\"hello\"}, \"_\"));\r\n  // s == \"h_e_l_l_o\"\r\n  ```\r\n  Thanks [@BRevzin (Barry Revzin)](https://github.com/BRevzin).\r\n\r\n* Added support for named args, `clear` and `reserve` to `dynamic_format_arg_store` (#1655, #1663, #1674, #1677). Thanks [@vsolontsov-ll (Vladimir Solontsov)](https://github.com/vsolontsov-ll).\r\n\r\n* Added support for the `'c'` format specifier to integral types for compatibility with `std::format` (#1652).\r\n\r\n* Replaced the `'n'` format specifier with `'L'` for compatibility with `std::format` (#1624). The `'n'` specifier can be enabled via the `FMT_DEPRECATED_N_SPECIFIER` macro.\r\n\r\n* The `'='` format specifier is now disabled by default for compatibility with `std::format`. It can be enabled via the `FMT_DEPRECATED_NUMERIC_ALIGN` macro.\r\n\r\n* Removed the following deprecated APIs:\r\n\r\n  * `FMT_STRING_ALIAS` and `fmt` macros - replaced by `FMT_STRING`\r\n  \r\n  * `fmt::basic_string_view::char_type` - replaced by `fmt::basic_string_view::value_type`\r\n  \r\n  * `convert_to_int`\r\n  \r\n  * `format_arg_store::types`\r\n  \r\n  * `*parse_context` - replaced by `*format_parse_context`\r\n  \r\n  * `FMT_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_OS`\r\n  \r\n  * `FMT_DEPRECATED_PERCENT` - incompatible with `std::format`\r\n  \r\n  * `*writer` - replaced by compiled format API\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n* Renamed the `internal` namespace to `detail` (#1538). The former is still provided as an alias if the `FMT_USE_INTERNAL` macro is defined.\r\n\r\n* Improved compatibility between `fmt::printf` with the standard specs (#1595, #1682, #1683, #1687, #1699). Thanks [@rimathia](https://github.com/rimathia).\r\n\r\n* Fixed handling of `operator<<` overloads that use `copyfmt` (#1666).\r\n\r\n* Added the `FMT_OS` CMake option to control inclusion of OS-specific APIs in the fmt target. This can be useful for embedded platforms (#1654, #1656). Thanks [@kwesolowski (Krzysztof Wesolowski)](https://github.com/kwesolowski).\r\n\r\n* Replaced `FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION` with the `FMT_FUZZ` macro to prevent interferring with fuzzing of projects using {fmt} (#1650). Thanks [@asraa (Asra Ali)](https://github.com/asraa).\r\n\r\n* Fixed compatibility with emscripten (#1636, #1637).
