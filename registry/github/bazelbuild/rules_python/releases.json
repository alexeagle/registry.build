Instead of all extensions being in a single `extensions.bzl` file, each extension is in its own file. Users must update the file path in their `use_repo()` statements as follows:\r\n\r\n* `use_extension(\"@rules_python//python:extensions.bzl\", \"python\")` -> `use_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:python.bzl\", \"python\")`\r\n* `use_extension(\"@rules_python//python:extensions.bzl\", \"pip\")` -> `use_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:pip.bzl\", \"pip\")`\r\n\r\nThe following `sed` commands should approximate the necessary changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsed 'sXuse_extension(\"@rules_python//python:extensions.bzl\", \"python\")Xuse_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:python.bzl\", \"python\")X'`\r\nsed 'sXuse_extension(\"@rules_python//python:extensions.bzl\", \"pip\")Xuse_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:pip.bzl\", \"pip\")X'`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee `examples/bzlmod_build_file_generation/MODULE.bazel` for an example of the new paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lockfile output churn\r\n\r\nThe output of lockfiles has slightly changed. Though functionally the same, their integrity hashes will change.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6\r\n\r\nNOTE: Bzlmod support is still in beta.\r\n\r\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name = \"rules_python\", version = \"0.22.0\")\r\n\r\npip = use_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:pip.bzl\", \"pip\")\r\n\r\npip.parse(\r\n    name = \"pip\",\r\n    requirements_lock = \"//:requirements_lock.txt\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nuse_repo(pip, \"pip\")\r\n\r\n# (Optional) Register a specific python toolchain instead of using the host version\r\npython = use_extension(\"@rules_python//python/extensions:python.bzl\", \"python\")\r\n\r\npython.toolchain(\r\n    name = \"python3_9\",\r\n    python_version = \"3.9\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nuse_repo(python, \"python3_9_toolchains\")\r\n\r\nregister_toolchains(\r\n    \"@python3_9_toolchains//:all\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using WORKSPACE\r\n\r\nPaste this snippet into your `WORKSPACE` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"rules_python\",\r\n    sha256 =

\"py_repositories\")\r\n\r\npy_repositories()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Gazelle plugin\r\n\r\nPaste this snippet into your `WORKSPACE`

the prior 0.17 tags (0.17.0, 0.17.1, and 0.17.2) were never published as releases and can be ignored.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Change\r\n\r\nThe Gazelle extension for Python has been updated to better integrate with the conventions of Python and Bazel. This includes changes to how test files with the prefix or suffix of \"test_\" and \"*_test\" are handled. If a __test__ target is not present, these files will now be added to individual py_test targets. To align your projects with these changes, any test utility files that were previously included in py_library targets and have the aforementioned prefix or suffix, will need to be renamed for consistency.\r\n\r\nTo use the gazelle extension you must now fetch another external repository, `rules_python_gazelle_plugin`, see the snippet below.\r\nAlso, change your gazelle binary registration to load from this new repository:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\ngazelle(\r\n    name = \"gazelle\",\r\n    data = GAZELLE_PYTHON_RUNTIME_DEPS,\r\n    gazelle = \"@rules_python_gazelle_plugin//python:gazelle_binary\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6\r\n\r\nAdd to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nbazel_dep(name =

repository rule `python_register_toolchains` that generated a \"magically-named\" repo with `_resolved_interpreter` as the suffix, like this:\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\npython_register_toolchains(\r\n    name = \"python3_9\",\r\n    # Available versions are listed in @rules_python//python:versions.bzl.\r\n    # We recommend using the same version your team is already standardized on.\r\n    python_version = \"3.9\",\r\n)\r\nload(\"@python3_9_resolved_interpreter//:defs.bzl\", \"interpreter\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 0.8.0 that suffix is removed, so the resolved toolchain is just named the same as you provide. In that example the last line would now be\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@python3_9//:defs.bzl\", \"interpreter\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* release: Fix release snippet by @alexeagle in

moved to a BUILD file as it is a regular rule. See the updates to `examples/build_file_generation` in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/578/files\r\n\r\nUsers of `pip_parse` (or `pip_repository(incremental=True)`) will have the generated repositories change, e.g. from `@pip_pypi__amqp//:pkg` to `@amqp//:pkg`. If you use the `requirements()` helper, this won't affect you, but if you referred to the generated labels directly it will.\r\nYou can add the attribute `repo_prefix = \"pip_pypi__\"` on `pip_parse` to restore the previous default.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Fix regression in parsing requirements due to invalid entry points config. by @UebelAndre in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/536\r\n* Add tags pypi_name and pypi_version to generated py_library targets by @alexeagle in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/530\r\n*
