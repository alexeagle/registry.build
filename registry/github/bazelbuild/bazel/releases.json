[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.0rc1 (2024-07-29)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Bazel now supports vendoring external dependencies with Bzlmod, see https://bazel.build/external/vendor for details. ([#22794](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22794))\r\n* Added a new flag, --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names, which uses the plus character (+) instead of the tilde (~) in canonical repo names. This flag will be flipped to true in Bazel 8.0. ([#23127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23127))\r\n* The extract method is now available on module_ctx. ([#22825](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22825))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`. For more information, refer to the discussion [#22658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658). ([#22876](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22876))\r\n* Actions that become identical when path mapped are now deduplicated during local execution ([#21043](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21043))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.1...release-7.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Honnix, Jordan Mele, Laurent Le Brun, and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Replace //external:android/d8_jar_import with \"@android_gmaven_r8//jar\" ([#22699](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22699))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix crash on IOException in SingleExtensionEvalFunction ([#22697](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22697))\r\n* You can now discard previous overrides for --override_repository and --override_module by specifying an empty path. For example, if --override_repository=myrepo=/foo is followed by --override_repository=myrepo=, then myrepo will not be overridden. ([#22784](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22784))\r\n* Overlay files specified in source.json are now assumed to be under the `overlay` subdirectory. ([#22823](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22823))\r\n* Fixed an issue with the WORKSPACE file still being evaluated when `--noenable_workspace` is set. ([#22837](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22837))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix an NPE with the compact execution log and coverage ([#22707](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22707))\r\n* Retry on connection reset error for http cache. ([#22785](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22785))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Fix permissions on tree artifact subdirectories as needed to move them out of the sandbox. ([#22806](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22806))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Do not fail a sandboxed spawn for missing execution statistics ([#22790](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22790))\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.2.1rc2 (2024-06-21)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Replace //external:android/d8_jar_import with \"@android_gmaven_r8//jar\" ([#22699](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22699))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix crash on IOException in SingleExtensionEvalFunction ([#22697](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22697))\r\n* You can now discard previous overrides for --override_repository and --override_module by specifying an empty path. For example, if --override_repository=myrepo=/foo is followed by --override_repository=myrepo=, then myrepo will not be overridden. ([#22784](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22784))\r\n* Overlay files specified in source.json are now assumed to be under the `overlay` subdirectory. ([#22823](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22823))\r\n* Fixed an issue with the WORKSPACE file still being evaluated when `--noenable_workspace` is set. ([#22837](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22837))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix an NPE with the compact execution log and coverage ([#22707](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22707))\r\n* Retry on connection reset error for http cache. ([#22785](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22785))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Fix permissions on tree artifact subdirectories as needed to move them out of the sandbox. ([#22806](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22806))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Do not fail a sandboxed spawn for missing execution statistics ([#22790](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22790))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.0...release-7.2.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0 (2024-06-10)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n* Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup. ([#22650](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22650))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc3 (2024-06-05)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n* Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup. ([#22650](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22650))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc2 (2024-05-29)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc1 (2024-05-15)\r\n\r\nBaseline: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3e4e2af78d5b7d210094acfe43abdda23b185be1\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n    * Known issue: bazel mod tidy doesn't yet work with include()d segments. Will be fixed in rc2.\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Set public visibility for R8 desugar binary ([#22176](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22176))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fixed excessive repo fetching caused by changes to `.netrc` ([#22186](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22186))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't upload remote input to remote cache ([#21941](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21941))\r\n* Implement RemoteActionFileSystem#statIfFound correctly when the path cannot be canonicalized ([#21889](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21889))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.2rc1 (2024-05-06)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  3e4e2af78d5b7d210094acfe43abdda23b185be1\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.2 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fixed excessive repo fetching caused by changes to `.netrc` ([#22186](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22186))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't upload remote input to remote cache ([#21941](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21941))\r\n* Implement RemoteActionFileSystem#statIfFound correctly when the path cannot be canonicalized ([#21889](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21889))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n* Reverted the 7.1.0 change to make `bazel fetch` use `cquery` under the hood ([#21735](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21735))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n* Fix sandbox cleanup crashing after server restart ([#21733](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21733))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.1rc2 (2024-03-19)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  9b39ccaa33069c9f5688bef477abcd75e4378f04\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n* Reverted the 7.1.0 change to make `bazel fetch` use `cquery` under the hood ([#21735](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21735))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n* Fix sandbox cleanup crashing after server restart ([#21733](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21733))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.1rc1 (2024-03-15)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  9b39ccaa33069c9f5688bef477abcd75e4378f04\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

([#21512](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21512))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new repo rule and module extension APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees: ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n    * New methods `repository_ctx.watch()` and `module_ctx.watch()` allow changes to a path to trigger a refetch/re-evaluation of the repo/extension.\r\n    * Several methods such as `repository_ctx.read()` and `repository_ctx.template()` gain a new watch parameter to allow them to watch for changes to the path in question.\r\n    * `path.readdir()` now watches for changes under the directory by default.\r\n    * New method `repository_ctx.watch_tree()` allows changes to anything transitively under a directory tree to trigger a repo refetch.\r\n* Added path.is_dir to detect whether a path points to a directory.\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json`. ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1 in bazel_tools builtin module.\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.1.0rc2 (2024-03-07)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  8f4b11520f9ac7f24018b3a53c8a228aeae71876\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag). ([#21512](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21512))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new repo rule and module extension APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees: ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n    * New methods `repository_ctx.watch()` and module_ctx.watch() allow changes to a path to trigger a refetch/re-evaluation of the repo/extension.\r\n    * Several methods such as repository_ctx.read() and repository_ctx.template() gain a new watch parameter to allow them to watch for changes to the path in question.\r\n    * path.readdir() now watches for changes under the directory by default.\r\n    * New method repository_ctx.watch_tree() allows changes to anything transitively under a directory tree to trigger a repo refetch.\r\n* Added path.is_dir to detect whether a path points to a directory.\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json`. ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1 in bazel_tools builtin module.\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers. ([#21429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21429))\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Artem V.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.1.0rc1 (2024-02-22)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  8f4b11520f9ac7f24018b3a53c8a228aeae71876\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees `repository_ctx.watch`, `repository_ctx.watch_tree`. ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json` ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* Minimum rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers. ([#21429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21429))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/7.0.2...7.1.0rc1) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Artem V.

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Fix tree file materialized as symlink to another file when building without the bytes. ([#20409](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20409))\r\n* Fix bootstrapped Bazel binary ([#20804](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20804))\r\n* Ignore read-only errors when updating the `mtime` of the `install_base` ([#20568](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20568))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Fix versioned shared libraries for macOS toolchain ([#20847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20847))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Flip --incompatible_visibility_private_attributes_at_definition ([#20520](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20520))\r\n* Implemented --incompatible_enable_proto_toolchain_resolution ([#20925](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20925))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Fix extraction of tar archives containing sparse files. ([#20531](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20531))\r\n* Restart at most once when prepopulating repository rule environment ([#20667](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20667))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Don't pass --add-opens= to javac ([#20472](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20472))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* RemoteSpawnRunner: record inbetween phases in timing profile ([#20550](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20550))\r\n* Add profiling to `remoteActionBuildingSemaphore.acquire()` ([#20549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20549))\r\n* Add flag `experimental_throttle_remote_action_building` ([#20861](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20861))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build API\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20590](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20590))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing \r\n    * `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements:\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Fabian Meumertzheim, Jordan Mele, Rahul Butani, and Son Luong Ngoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

d798ebde6c6394203a87b5f1a6b62ecfc3880991\r\n\r\nBazel 7.0.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Fix linker feature detection being performed on wrong linker ([#20901](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20901))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Let module extensions track calls to `Label()` ([#20750](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20750))\r\n* Fix bootstrapped Bazel binary ([#20612](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20612))\r\n* Attempt to make main repo mapping inverse more efficient ([#20625](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20625))\r\n* Let .bzl files record their usages of repo mapping ([#20848](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20848))\r\n* Consider MODULE.bazel for workspace detection in bazel.sh ([#20594](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20594))\r\n* Avoid emitting canonical labels into generated repos ([#20840](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20840))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Auto-create deploy jars for Bazel `java_test` targets if requested ([#20602](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20602))\r\n* `java_binary` wrapper should forward `restricted_to` ([#20611](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20611))\r\n* Fix singlejar resource mapping for external repositories ([#20904](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20904))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Mount user-specified bind mounts before Bazel's own magic. ([#20609](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20609))\r\n* Print interactive sandboxed shell command with `--sandbox_debug` ([#20734](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20734))\r\n* Fix two issues with --incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp that manifested themselves when the output base was under /tmp ([#20718](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20718))\r\n* Add support for bind mounts under `/tmp` with hermetic tmp ([#20749](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20749))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Force output checking for incremental run commands without the bytes.

See the [Bzlmod migration guide](http://bazel.build/external/migration) for more information.\r\n* Bazel now starts executing actions while it is still analyzing other top-level targets (Project Skymeld).\r\n  * This reduces end-to-end wall time for multi-target builds by up to 15%.\r\n* Platform-based toolchain resolution is now enabled for Android and C++. \r\n  * Android rules now use platforms and toolchains to control the target devices.. Android projects will need to stop passing the legacy flag `--fat_apk_cpu`, and instead use `--android_platforms` using platforms defined with the `@platforms//os:android` constraint. The https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android repository defines four standard Android platforms for projects that use those rules, `@rules_android//:armeabi-v7a`, `@rules_android//:arm64-v8a`, `@rules_android//:x86`, `@rules_android//:x86_64`. Full details are available in [the Android Platforms announcement](https://blog.bazel.build/2023/11/15/android-platforms.html).\r\n* Build without the Bytes (BwoB) is now enabled by default (`--remote_download_outputs` now defaults to `toplevel`). \r\n  * This reduces the number of downloaded artifacts when using remote caching and execution significantly, speeding up builds by up to 40%. \r\n  * This mode also enables Bazel to gracefully handle remote cache evictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Migration-Ready Incompatible Flags\r\nPrepare for future Bazel changes by using the following incompatible flags for early migration:\r\n* --[incompatible_auto_exec_groups](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17134)\r\n* --incompatible_disable_non_executable_java_binary\r\n* --[incompatible_disallow_struct_provider_syntax](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19467) \r\n* --[incompatible_disable_target_provider_fields](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19466)\r\n* --[incompatible_struct_has_no_methods](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19465)\r\n* --[incompatible_stop_exporting_language_modules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19455)\r\n* --[incompatible_disallow_empty_glob](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8195)\r\n* --[incompatible_disable_starlark_host_transitions](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17032)\r\n* --[incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933)\r\n\r\nAlready flipped and will be removed at head:\r\n* --incompatible_no_attr_license\r\n* --[incompatible_disable_objc_library_transition](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688) \r\n* --[incompatible_fail_on_unknown_attributes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19403)\r\n* --incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution\r\n* --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view\r\n* --incompatible_always_check_depset_elements\r\n* --incompatible_visibility_private_attributes_at_definition\r\n* --incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs\r\n\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Many flags have been removed as part of the effort to remove and clean up unused flags (see the appendix for a full list; also [#19296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/19296)).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_check_sharding_support` is enabled by default. Sharded tests with test runners that do not properly advertise support for test sharding will fail. Refer to [#18339](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18339) for migration advice.\r\nBazel’s embedded JVM has been upgraded to JDK 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The flag --android_include_proguard_location_references is removed and --no_proguard_location_reference is now added unconditionally to the command line of aapt2.\r\n* Updated Android manifest merger to v30.1.3.\r\n* Dropped support for legacy (pre-D8) desugaring.\r\n* Added support for optimizers rewriting baseline profiles.\r\n* Android resources will no longer propagate through neverlinked libraries by default.\r\n* Set Android Databinding to v2 and Databinding AndroidX to true and remove support for Databinding V1.\r\n\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Added a new flag `--incompatible_use_host_features`. When this flag is enabled, `--features` only applies to targets built in the target configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec configuration\r\n* **[Incompatible]** C++ rules use platform-based toolchain resolution (`--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution` is now on). See [#7260](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Remove 'darwin' as a CPU value, use 'darwin_x86_64' instead\r\n* **[Incompatible]** cc_binary targets with dynamic_deps attributes no longer link indirect dynamic_deps on Unix. This might be an incompatible change if you are using RUNPATHs (instead of RPATHs) in your cc_shared_librarys. Enable the feature exclude_bazel_rpaths_in_transitive_libs or use_rpath_instead_of_runpath for those cc_shared_librarys.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `cc_host_toolchain_alias` rule is deleted. Please use `cc_toolchain_alias` rule instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Removed apple_crosstool_transition. Use transition_support.apple_rule_transition from rules_apple instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n* C++ rules on Windows calling cc_common.create_linking_context_from_compilation_outputs check whether each target of the rule type should produce a dynamic library. This check used to be part of cc_common API, but is now moved to the caller rules instead.\r\n* C++ branch coverage is now enabled if gcov version is 8 or newer.\r\n* cc_shared_library is no longer experimental, see [#16709](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16709) for details\r\n* cc_test can now be configured by using a native.toolchain()\r\n* `objc_library` now produces better error messages while expanding make variables.\r\n* Unexpected C/C++ absolute includes now result in more descriptive error messages for unexpected cc absolute includes. They are not reported anymore reported as \"undeclared inclusion(s)\"\r\n* Compilation actions using the auto-configured MSVC toolchain are forced to emit error messages in English if the English language pack for Visual Studio is installed.\r\n* Fixed includes attribute of `objc_library` when sibling repository layout is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The flag `--extra_execution_platforms` no longer accumulates values over multiple specifications. To use multiple execution platforms, set `--extra_execution_platforms=platform1,platform2` instead of `--extra_execution_platforms=platform1 --extra_execution-platforms=platform2`.  The former registers both `platform1` and `platform2` while the latter overrides `platform1` with `platform2`. \r\n* **[Incompatible]** `copy_from_rule` on exec_group is deprecated ([#17668](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17668)).\r\n[Incompatible] `platform`, `constraint_setting`, and `constraint_value` no longer take an `applicable_licenses` value. Use package level defaults instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `default_package_metadata` doesn't apply to `platform`, `constraint_setting`, or `constraint_value` anymore. \r\n* **[Incompatible]** Duplicates in <rule-inputs> when using `query --output=xml --aspect_deps=precise` are removed.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Starlark API: removed outdated `ctx.host_fragments`, `ctx.host_configuration`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `genrule.exec_tools` is removed. Use `genrule.tools` instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `@bazel_tools//config:common_settings.bzl` has been removed. Use `@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl` instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_visibility_private_attributes_at_definition` is flipped to true. This supports prohibiting references to tools and `config_settings` used by internal rule logic. See [#19330](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19330).\r\n* The new flag `--use_target_platform_for_tests` allows one to execute tests with the target platform instead of the execution platform.\r\n* The new flag `--skip_incompatible_explicit_targets` can be used to skip incompatible targets even when explicitly requested on the command line. This changes the default behavior of reporting an error in this case. See https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#when-targets-skipped.\r\n* Added flag `--proto:include_attribute_source_aspects` that will include a new field `source_aspect_name` to the `Attribute` message that indicates the source aspect that the attribute comes from.\r\n* `default_applicable_licenses` in `package()` now applies to the entire BUILD file, regardless of where in the BUILD that `package()` is called.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Core\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** When multiple --deleted_packages options are passed on the command line, they will be concatenated instead of the latest one taking effect.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** JVM options in environment variables JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS now do not get to the server anymore; use --host_jvm_args instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is enabled by default: actions are now forbidden from creating an output directory where a file was expected.\r\n* The location of rules that explicitly specify `generator_name` and/or `generator_function` attributes (typically because they are incidentally copied from [`native.existing_rule()`](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/toplevel/native#existing_rule)) is now the top-level call in the `BUILD` file, which is consistent with rules that do not explicitly specify these attributes.\r\n* Warnings (most notably those associated with the [`deprecation` rule attribute](https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#common-attributes)) are no longer replayed on subsequent invocations unless the target in question is re-analyzed. Warnings are purely informational, so this change has no bearing on the correctness of the build. Downstream tests that break due to this change should update their expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with --enable_bzlmod:\r\n   1. root module’s module file\r\n   2. WORKSPACE (or WORKSPACE.bzlmod if present)\r\n   3. non-root modules’ module files\r\n   4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with WORKSPACE.bzlmod or execution platforms)\r\n* Bzlmod lockfile is enabled by default (--lockfile_mode defaults to update).\r\n* Added a new `max_compatibility_level` attribute to the `bazel_dep` directive, which allows version selection to upgrade a dependency up to the specified compatibility level.\r\n* Bazel now throws an error if the root module specifies overrides on nonexistent modules.\r\n* Added support for a new directive `use_repo_rule` in MODULE.bazel files, which allows you to conveniently declare repos that are only visible within your module.\r\n* --experimental_repository_disable_download is now promoted to stable and is also available under the name --repository_disable_download.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The deprecated fields transitive_deps, transitive_runtime_deps are dropped from JavaInfo\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_java_proto_library_default_has_services command line option and the Starlark symbol java_common.experimental_java_proto_library_default_has_services function are not available anymore.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** java_test no longer produces deploy jars.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** JavaInfo.java_outputs.source_jars now returns a Depset. See [#18966](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18966).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Java toolchains rules are moved from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk` to rules_java ([#18558](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18558)), please switch to using the rules from `@rules_java`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference):\r\n  * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration.\r\n  * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform.\r\n  * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see [#18265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18265)).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The moving of some rules and providers from native to Starlark changes the output of the providers function with cquery. (see [#20473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20473))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Bazel's local CPU resource on Linux is now container aware. Use `--local_cpu_resources`, `--loading_phase_threads` or `--jobs` to override.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The sandboxfs sandboxing strategy has been removed. It hadn't been maintained for a long time, it didn't work for most users and it was not consistently faster while being complex to set up.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** High priority workers functionality has been removed as we have not seen faster builds in scenarios they have been designed for.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default.\r\n* Directories used by sandboxed non-worker execution may be reused to avoid unnecessary setup costs. This behavior can be disabled with --noreuse_sandbox_directories.\r\n* Symlink trees created by sandboxing will be deleted asynchronously. This behavior can be disabled with --experimental_sandbox_async_tree_delete_idle_threads=0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Fixed spitting out multiple “Build completed” messages, and made them subject to filtering with `--ui_event_filters`. This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful builds from `FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully (0 packages loaded)` to `ERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** JSON profile: Counter series are now doubles instead of strings.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--experimental_execution_graph_log` no longer exists. Current users that want local logs need to pass `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log --experimental_execution_graph_log_path=/some/local/path`. Current users that want logs uploaded to BEP need to pass `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --experimental_genquery_use_graphless_query is now a NO-OP.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Changes to --execution_log_{json,binary}_file:\r\n  * Outputs are now correctly populated when building without the bytes\r\n  * Action digest is now correctly populated in cache hits\r\n  * The redundant progress_message and walltime fields have been removed\r\n  * The remote_cache_hit field is now called cache_hit, as it’s also set for disk cache hits\r\n  * Log sorting may now be disabled by setting --noexecution_log_sort\r\n  * It’s no longer possible to simultaneously request both execution log formats\r\n  * The --experimental_execution_log_spawn_metrics flag has been removed; the spawn metrics are now unconditionally set\r\n  * The --experimental_execution_log_file flag has been removed; use --execution_log_binary_file together with --noexecution_log_sort\r\n* Add `aquery --output=streamed_proto` which writes a stream of length delimited ActionGraphContainer containing a single Artifact, Action, Target, DepSetOfFiles, Configuration, AspectDescriptor, RuleClass, PathFragment proto. This breaks up the ActionGraphContainer into multiple ones which will prevent large protos from crashing Bazel.\r\n* (BEP) TargetConfigured events will be marked aborted instead of published when there is an analysis error. This is motivated by a low level Blaze change aimed at improving scalability.\r\n* The new `--consistent_labels` option on `query`, `cquery`, and `aquery` can be used to force consistent label formatting across all output modes that is also compatible with `str(Label(...))` in Starlark.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --experimental_build_transitive_python_runfiles is flipped to false. Setting it to true is no longer supported. See #16303 for details\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --incompatible_python_disable_py2 is flipped to true. See [#17293](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17293) and [#15684](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15684) for details.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** py_transitions top-level has been removed.\r\n* The Python rules built into Bazel have been reimplemented in Starlark, which introduces a handful of incompatible edge cases. See [#15897](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15897) for details.\r\n  * The `stamp` attribute can no longer be a configurable (`select`-based) boolean value.\r\n  * The `legacy_create_init` attribute can no longer be a configurable (`select`-based) boolean value.\r\n  * In `cquery` commands, the PyInfo and PyRuntimeInfo provider names, as returned by the `providers()` function, have changed.\r\n  * For `py_test` to add the `requires-darwin` execution requirement, the Apple OS constraints (`@platforms//os:{ios,macos,tvos,watchos}`) must match. Setting the `--cpu` flag (e.g `--cpu=darwin_x86_64`) isn't sufficient.\r\n* The flags `--incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules` and `--python_native_rules_allowlist` have been added to aid migrating code from using the builtin Bazel Python rules to using rules_python. See [#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773) for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Building without the bytes is now the default (i.e., `--remote_download_outputs` defaults to `toplevel`, meaning that only the outputs of top-level targets and those required by local actions will be downloaded). To download additional outputs, use `--remote_download_regex`. To revert to downloading all outputs, set `--remote_download_all`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** When an incremental build fails because one or more blobs were evicted from the disk/remote cache, Bazel will now exit with exit code 39. Set `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` to automatically retry the build in this case.\r\n* Add flags `--experimental_remote_cache_lease_extension` and `--experimental_remote_cache_ttl`, defaulting to 3 hours, allowing Bazel to automatically extend leases on remote cache blobs while a build is in progress\r\n* `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload` has been renamed to `--remote_build_event_upload`.\r\n* `--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata` has been renamed to `--action_cache_store_output_metadata`.\r\n* Changed the default value for `--remote_build_event_upload` to `minimal`.\r\n* `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` has been renamed to `--remote_cache_compression`.\r\n* `--experimental_remote_grpc_log` has been renamed to `--remote_grpc_log`.\r\n* `--incompatible_remote_build_event_upload_respect_no_cache` is now a no-op.\r\n* Non-ASCII arguments are now correctly written to parameter files instead of as mojibake.\r\n* --remote_download_minimal no longer implies --nobuild_runfile_links.\r\n* –remote_download_{toplevel,minimal} no longer imply --experimental_inmemory_{jdeps,dotd}_files, which now default to true.\r\n* `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `cmd_helper` module has been removed.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `ctx.new_file` has been removed; `ctx.actions.declare_file` is to be used instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** proto_compiler attribute removed from proto_lang_toolchain (it was recently introduced, and there is no evidence of use)\r\n* **[Incompatible]** testing.analysis_test is not experimental anymore.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Non-existent rule attributes can not be set anymore, not even to None. See [#19403](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19403).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --incompatible_merge_fixed_and_default_shell_env is flipped to true. See [#19317](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19317) for details.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The rule function now takes only the implementation function positionally; other parameters have to be named.\r\n* Double value positive infinity is now correctly encoded as \"inf\" instead of \"+inf\" for textprotos.\r\n* json.decode now takes an optional `default` parameter; if this parameter is specified and decoding fails, json.decode will return the `default` value instead of failing Starlark evaluation.\r\n* starlark_doc_extract is enabled. It's a native rule for Starlark documentation extraction. This rule is intended mainly for internal use by Stardoc.\r\n* `rule()` and `attr.*` can no longer be (pointlessly) called during WORKSPACE evaluation and repository rule evaluation.\r\n* attr objects in Starlark now use value equality rather than reference equality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Appendix: Removed flags\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The following flags are removed as part of the effort to remove and clean up

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Ensure that extension unique names followed by `~` are prefix-free ([#19167](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19167))\r\n* Module extensions can now specify a list of environment variables to watch through the [environ](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/globals/bzl#module_extension.environ) parameter.\r\n* The module lockfile can now deal with missing fields due to Bazel version upgrades. ([#19175](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19175))\r\n* Module extensions are now re-evaluated if any labels they depend on change, similar to repo rules. ([#19175](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19175))\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

Release 6.3.1 (2023-07-31)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  0f231ac8acabcd8aa309da041c98ab90a1552418\r\n\r\nBazel 6.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Disabled lockfile support by default due to issue reports ([#19105](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19105) and [#19068](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19068)). Will be re-enabled in the next minor release.\r\n* Mark isolated extension usages as experimental ([#19050](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19050))\r\n* Fix a bug where frozen targets list was mutated while expanding env attribute ([#19052](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19052))\r\n* Advertise CcInfo from cc_import ([#19086](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19086))\r\n* Update java_tools to v12.6 ([#19091](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19091))\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones and Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

 758b44dab552f31b378874b5bf4c0609bfef6f5d\r\n\r\nBazel 6.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* The new bazel mod command allows users to inspect their external dependency graph in Bzlmod. See [documentation](https://bazel.build/versions/6.3.0/external/mod-command) for details.\r\n* Full lockfile support has been added to Bzlmod and is now enabled by default.
