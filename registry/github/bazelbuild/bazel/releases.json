It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Add support for using the java rules from @rules_java ([#23779](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23779))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.1...release-7.3.2) for more details.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

([#23281](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23281))\r\n* Fixed a crash when vendoring alias targets. ([#23309](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23309))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Revert \"Deduplicate locally executed path mapped spawns” ([#23290](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23290))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.0...release-7.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.1rc2 (2024-08-14)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## ExternalDeps\r\n* Fixed the lockfile always being considered out of date when `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` is set. ([#23281](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23281))\r\n* Fixed a crash when vendoring alias targets. ([#23309](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23309))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Revert \"Deduplicate locally executed path mapped spawns” ([#23290](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23290))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.0...release-7.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

(2024-08-13)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## ExternalDeps\r\n* Fixed the lockfile always being considered out of date when `--incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names` is set. ([#23281](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23281))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.3.0...release-7.3.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

([#22794](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22794))\r\n* Added a new flag, --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names, which uses the plus character (+) instead of the tilde (~) in canonical repo names. This flag will be flipped to true in Bazel 8.0. ([#23127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23127))\r\n* The extract method is now available on module_ctx. ([#22825](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22825))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`. For more information, refer to the discussion [#22658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658). ([#22876](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22876))\r\n* Actions that become identical when path mapped are now deduplicated during local execution ([#21043](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21043))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.1...release-7.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Honnix, Jordan Mele, Laurent Le Brun, and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.0rc2 (2024-08-07)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Bazel now supports vendoring external dependencies with Bzlmod, see https://bazel.build/external/vendor for details. ([#22794](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22794))\r\n* Added a new flag, --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names, which uses the plus character (+) instead of the tilde (~) in canonical repo names. This flag will be flipped to true in Bazel 8.0. ([#23127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23127))\r\n* The extract method is now available on module_ctx. ([#22825](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22825))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`. For more information, refer to the discussion [#22658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658). ([#22876](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22876))\r\n* Actions that become identical when path mapped are now deduplicated during local execution ([#21043](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21043))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.1...release-7.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Honnix, Jordan Mele, Laurent Le Brun, and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.3.0rc1 (2024-07-29)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Bazel now supports vendoring external dependencies with Bzlmod, see https://bazel.build/external/vendor for details. ([#22794](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22794))\r\n* Added a new flag, --incompatible_use_plus_in_repo_names, which uses the plus character (+) instead of the tilde (~) in canonical repo names. This flag will be flipped to true in Bazel 8.0. ([#23127](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/23127))\r\n* The extract method is now available on module_ctx. ([#22825](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22825))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Experimental support for path mapping `CppCompile` actions can be enabled via `--modify_execution_info=CppCompile=+supports-path-mapping`. For more information, refer to the discussion [#22658](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/22658). ([#22876](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22876))\r\n* Actions that become identical when path mapped are now deduplicated during local execution ([#21043](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/21043))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.1...release-7.3.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Cornelius Riemenschneider, David Sanderson, Fabian Meumertzheim, Honnix, Jordan Mele, Laurent Le Brun, and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Replace //external:android/d8_jar_import with \"@android_gmaven_r8//jar\" ([#22699](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22699))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix crash on IOException in SingleExtensionEvalFunction ([#22697](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22697))\r\n* You can now discard previous overrides for --override_repository and --override_module by specifying an empty path. For example, if --override_repository=myrepo=/foo is followed by --override_repository=myrepo=, then myrepo will not be overridden. ([#22784](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22784))\r\n* Overlay files specified in source.json are now assumed to be under the `overlay` subdirectory. ([#22823](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22823))\r\n* Fixed an issue with the WORKSPACE file still being evaluated when `--noenable_workspace` is set. ([#22837](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22837))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix an NPE with the compact execution log and coverage ([#22707](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22707))\r\n* Retry on connection reset error for http cache. ([#22785](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22785))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Fix permissions on tree artifact subdirectories as needed to move them out of the sandbox. ([#22806](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22806))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Do not fail a sandboxed spawn for missing execution statistics ([#22790](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22790))\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.2.1rc2 (2024-06-21)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Replace //external:android/d8_jar_import with \"@android_gmaven_r8//jar\" ([#22699](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22699))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix crash on IOException in SingleExtensionEvalFunction ([#22697](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22697))\r\n* You can now discard previous overrides for --override_repository and --override_module by specifying an empty path. For example, if --override_repository=myrepo=/foo is followed by --override_repository=myrepo=, then myrepo will not be overridden. ([#22784](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22784))\r\n* Overlay files specified in source.json are now assumed to be under the `overlay` subdirectory. ([#22823](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22823))\r\n* Fixed an issue with the WORKSPACE file still being evaluated when `--noenable_workspace` is set. ([#22837](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22837))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Fix an NPE with the compact execution log and coverage ([#22707](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22707))\r\n* Retry on connection reset error for http cache. ([#22785](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22785))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Fix permissions on tree artifact subdirectories as needed to move them out of the sandbox. ([#22806](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22806))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Do not fail a sandboxed spawn for missing execution statistics ([#22790](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22790))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.2.0...release-7.2.1) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim and Simon Mavi Stewart.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0 (2024-06-10)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n* Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup. ([#22650](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22650))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc3 (2024-06-05)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n* Git merge conflicts in `MODULE.bazel.lock` files can be resolved automatically. See https://bazel.build/external/lockfile#automatic-resolution for the required setup. ([#22650](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22650))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc2 (2024-05-29)\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Bazel on Linux and BSD now respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME environment variable instead of assuming that ~/.cache/bazel is writable. ([#21817](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21817))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261), [#22573](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22573))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* The source.json file in registries now supports the overlay attribute in addition to patches. http_archive now has two more attributes, remote_file_urls and remote_file_integrity, to support this use case. ([#22325](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22325), [#22525](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22525))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n* `Label` instances passed to `print` or `fail` as positional arguments are now formatted with apparent repository names (optimized for human readability). ([#22460](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22460))\r\n* Changes to environment variables read via `mctx.getenv` now correctly invalidate module extensions. ([#22541](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22541))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Paths in the Linux sandbox are now again identical to those outside the sandbox, even with `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp`. ([#22407](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22407))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Isaac Torres, Keith Smiley, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.2.0rc1 (2024-05-15)\r\n\r\nBaseline: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/3e4e2af78d5b7d210094acfe43abdda23b185be1\r\n\r\nBazel 7.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* The default Unix C++ toolchain now supports the `parse_headers` feature to validate header files with `--process_headers_in_dependencies`. ([#22369](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22369))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* aquery: `//foo:bar` now means \"all configured targets with label `//foo:bar`\" instead of \"choose an arbitrary configured target with label `//foo:bar`\". This is in line with cquery behavior. ([#22135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22135))\r\n* Starlark command-line flags can now be referred to through `alias` targets. ([#22212](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22212))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_disable_native_repo_rules` to disable native repo rule usage in WORKSPACE. All native repo rules now have a Starlark counterpart that can be used in both WORKSPACE and Bzlmod; see #22080 for more details. ([#22203](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22203))\r\n* The format for `MODULE.bazel.lock` is now less likely to result in merge conflicts and is updated incrementally, with only new files downloaded from registries and existing ones taken from the repository cache (if configured). ([#22351](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22351))\r\n* bzlmod `git_override` now accepts the `strip_prefix` arg and passes it to the underlying `git_repository` call. ([#22137](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22137))\r\n* Added a new `include()` directive to `MODULE.bazel` files, which allows the root module file to be divided into multiple segments. ([#22204](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22204))\r\n    * Known issue: bazel mod tidy doesn't yet work with include()d segments. Will be fixed in rc2.\r\n* Fixed certain deadlocks in repo fetching with worker threads (`--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching=auto`). ([#22261](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22261))\r\n* `print` statements in module files are now only executed for the root module and modules subject to non-registry overrides (e.g. `local_path_override`). ([#22263](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22263))\r\n* The new `refresh` value for `--lockfile_mode` behaves like the `update` mode, but additionally forces a refresh of mutable registry content (yanked versions and missing module versions) when switched to or from time to time while enabled. ([#22371](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22371))\r\n* `bazel fetch` now more reliably fetches repos required for a build by triggering the analysis phase. ([#21841](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21841))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* The combined coverage report produced via `--combined_report=lcov` is now announced on the BES via the new `CoverageReport` event. ([#22327](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22327))\r\n* The compact and full execution logs now contain start times for spawns (if available). ([#22341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22341))\r\n* Added a new flag `--incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive`, which causes the `--modify_execution_info` flag to become additive when specified multiple times. ([#22316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22316))\r\n* Added new flags `--experimental_remote_output_service` and `--experimental_remote_output_service_output_path_prefix` for [remote output service](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/20933)\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n* Starlark `min` and `max` buitins now allow a `key` callback, similarly to `sorted`. ([#21960](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21960))\r\n* `native.package_relative_label` can now be used in rule initializers.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/release-7.1.1...release-7.2.0) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Cameron Martin, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Douglas Thor, Fabian Meumertzheim, George Gensure, Mark Elliot, Romain Chossart, Son Luong Ngoc, Spencer Putt, and Thomas Weischuh.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.2rc1 (2024-05-06)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  3e4e2af78d5b7d210094acfe43abdda23b185be1\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.2 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fixed excessive repo fetching caused by changes to `.netrc` ([#22186](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/22186))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Don't upload remote input to remote cache ([#21941](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21941))\r\n* Implement RemoteActionFileSystem#statIfFound correctly when the path cannot be canonicalized ([#21889](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21889))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n* Reverted the 7.1.0 change to make `bazel fetch` use `cquery` under the hood ([#21735](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21735))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n* Fix sandbox cleanup crashing after server restart ([#21733](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21733))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.1rc2 (2024-03-19)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  9b39ccaa33069c9f5688bef477abcd75e4378f04\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n* Reverted the 7.1.0 change to make `bazel fetch` use `cquery` under the hood ([#21735](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21735))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n* Fix sandbox cleanup crashing after server restart ([#21733](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21733))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.1rc1 (2024-03-15)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  9b39ccaa33069c9f5688bef477abcd75e4378f04\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

([#21512](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21512))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new repo rule and module extension APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees: ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n    * New methods `repository_ctx.watch()` and `module_ctx.watch()` allow changes to a path to trigger a refetch/re-evaluation of the repo/extension.\r\n    * Several methods such as `repository_ctx.read()` and `repository_ctx.template()` gain a new watch parameter to allow them to watch for changes to the path in question.\r\n    * `path.readdir()` now watches for changes under the directory by default.\r\n    * New method `repository_ctx.watch_tree()` allows changes to anything transitively under a directory tree to trigger a repo refetch.\r\n* Added path.is_dir to detect whether a path points to a directory.\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json`. ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1 in bazel_tools builtin module.\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.1.0rc2 (2024-03-07)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  8f4b11520f9ac7f24018b3a53c8a228aeae71876\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag). ([#21512](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21512))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new repo rule and module extension APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees: ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n    * New methods `repository_ctx.watch()` and module_ctx.watch() allow changes to a path to trigger a refetch/re-evaluation of the repo/extension.\r\n    * Several methods such as repository_ctx.read() and repository_ctx.template() gain a new watch parameter to allow them to watch for changes to the path in question.\r\n    * path.readdir() now watches for changes under the directory by default.\r\n    * New method repository_ctx.watch_tree() allows changes to anything transitively under a directory tree to trigger a repo refetch.\r\n* Added path.is_dir to detect whether a path points to a directory.\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json`. ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1 in bazel_tools builtin module.\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers. ([#21429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21429))\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Artem V.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.1.0rc1 (2024-02-22)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  8f4b11520f9ac7f24018b3a53c8a228aeae71876\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees `repository_ctx.watch`, `repository_ctx.watch_tree`. ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json` ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* Minimum rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers. ([#21429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21429))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/7.0.2...7.1.0rc1) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Artem V.

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Fix tree file materialized as symlink to another file when building without the bytes. ([#20409](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20409))\r\n* Fix bootstrapped Bazel binary ([#20804](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20804))\r\n* Ignore read-only errors when updating the `mtime` of the `install_base` ([#20568](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20568))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Fix versioned shared libraries for macOS toolchain ([#20847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20847))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Flip --incompatible_visibility_private_attributes_at_definition ([#20520](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20520))\r\n* Implemented --incompatible_enable_proto_toolchain_resolution ([#20925](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20925))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Fix extraction of tar archives containing sparse files. ([#20531](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20531))\r\n* Restart at most once when prepopulating repository rule environment ([#20667](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20667))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Don't pass --add-opens= to javac ([#20472](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20472))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* RemoteSpawnRunner: record inbetween phases in timing profile ([#20550](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20550))\r\n* Add profiling to `remoteActionBuildingSemaphore.acquire()` ([#20549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20549))\r\n* Add flag `experimental_throttle_remote_action_building` ([#20861](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20861))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build API\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20590](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20590))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing \r\n    * `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements:\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Fabian Meumertzheim, Jordan Mele, Rahul Butani, and Son Luong Ngoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

d798ebde6c6394203a87b5f1a6b62ecfc3880991\r\n\r\nBazel 7.0.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Fix linker feature detection being performed on wrong linker ([#20901](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20901))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Let module extensions track calls to `Label()` ([#20750](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20750))\r\n* Fix bootstrapped Bazel binary ([#20612](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20612))\r\n* Attempt to make main repo mapping inverse more efficient ([#20625](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20625))\r\n* Let .bzl files record their usages of repo mapping ([#20848](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20848))\r\n* Consider MODULE.bazel for workspace detection in bazel.sh ([#20594](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20594))\r\n* Avoid emitting canonical labels into generated repos ([#20840](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20840))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Auto-create deploy jars for Bazel `java_test` targets if requested ([#20602](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20602))\r\n* `java_binary` wrapper should forward `restricted_to` ([#20611](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20611))\r\n* Fix singlejar resource mapping for external repositories ([#20904](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20904))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Mount user-specified bind mounts before Bazel's own magic. ([#20609](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20609))\r\n* Print interactive sandboxed shell command with `--sandbox_debug` ([#20734](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20734))\r\n* Fix two issues with --incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp that manifested themselves when the output base was under /tmp ([#20718](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20718))\r\n* Add support for bind mounts under `/tmp` with hermetic tmp ([#20749](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20749))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Force output checking for incremental run commands without the bytes.
