[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n\r\n# Release 7.1.1rc1 (2024-03-15)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  9b39ccaa33069c9f5688bef477abcd75e4378f04\r\n\r\nBazel 7.1.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 7.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Fix `bazel mod tidy` failure with no changes ([#21662](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21662))\r\n* Allow any canonical repo name to be used with `bazel mod show_repo` ([#21694](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21694))\r\n* Fix two `bazel mod tidy` crashes ([#21700](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21700))\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n* Also inject a failure for createWritableDirectory when testing that ActionOutputDirectoryHelper propagates exceptions. ([#21683](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21683))\r\n* Fix race condition and add more logging for null entry error message ([#21692](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21692))\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Actually use shouldPublish() to determine whether to publish the execution log to the BEP. ([#21671](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21671))\r\n* Use execution info instead of hard-coded mnemonics for Java path mapping ([#21703](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21703))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Let native Turbine image find `ct.sym` with non-hermetic `java_runtime` ([#21670](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21670))\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

([#21512](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21512))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new repo rule and module extension APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees: ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n    * New methods `repository_ctx.watch()` and `module_ctx.watch()` allow changes to a path to trigger a refetch/re-evaluation of the repo/extension.\r\n    * Several methods such as `repository_ctx.read()` and `repository_ctx.template()` gain a new watch parameter to allow them to watch for changes to the path in question.\r\n    * `path.readdir()` now watches for changes under the directory by default.\r\n    * New method `repository_ctx.watch_tree()` allows changes to anything transitively under a directory tree to trigger a repo refetch.\r\n* Added path.is_dir to detect whether a path points to a directory.\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json`. ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1 in bazel_tools builtin module.\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.1.0rc2 (2024-03-07)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  8f4b11520f9ac7f24018b3a53c8a228aeae71876\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* `genrule` now supports setting `stamp = -1` to request conditional stamping (based on the value of the build's `--stamp` flag). ([#21512](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21512))\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new repo rule and module extension APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees: ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n    * New methods `repository_ctx.watch()` and module_ctx.watch() allow changes to a path to trigger a refetch/re-evaluation of the repo/extension.\r\n    * Several methods such as repository_ctx.read() and repository_ctx.template() gain a new watch parameter to allow them to watch for changes to the path in question.\r\n    * path.readdir() now watches for changes under the directory by default.\r\n    * New method repository_ctx.watch_tree() allows changes to anything transitively under a directory tree to trigger a repo refetch.\r\n* Added path.is_dir to detect whether a path points to a directory.\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json`. ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1 in bazel_tools builtin module.\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers. ([#21429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21429))\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Artem V.

[!NOTE] \r\n> If you are looking for [rolling releases](https://bazel.build/release#rolling-releases), please visit [this page](https://bazel.build/release/rolling).\r\n# Release 7.1.0rc1 (2024-02-22)\r\n\r\nBaseline:  8f4b11520f9ac7f24018b3a53c8a228aeae71876\r\n\r\n## External Deps\r\n* Added a flag `--enable_workspace` (defaults to `True`) that allows the user to completely disable WORKSPACE logic when turned off. We plan to change the default to `False` with Bazel 8. ([#20365](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20365))\r\n* Added new APIs to watch arbitrary files or directory trees `repository_ctx.watch`, `repository_ctx.watch_tree`. ([#21435](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21435))\r\n* Added a new method `repository_ctx.getenv`, which allows Starlark repository rules to declare environment variable dependencies during the fetch, instead of upfront using `repository_rule.environ`. ([#20944](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20944))\r\n* The flag `--experimental_worker_for_repo_fetching` now defaults to `auto`, which uses virtual threads from JDK 21 if it's available. This eliminates restarts during repo fetching. ([#21082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21082))\r\n* The new `bazel mod tidy` subcommand automatically updates `use_repo` calls in the `MODULE.bazel` file for extensions that use `module_ctx.extension_metadata`. ([#21265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21265))\r\n* `bazel mod dump_repo_mapping <canonical repo name>...` returns the repository mappings of the given repositories in NDJSON. This information can be used by IDEs and Starlark language servers to resolve labels with `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21023](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21023))\r\n* Added `init_submodules` attribute to `git_override`. Registries now support the `git_repository` type in `source.json` ([#21036](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21036))\r\n* Bazel's Bash completion can now complete external repository labels when using `--enable_bzlmod`. ([#21149](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21149))\r\n* Fixed `bazel fetch` by replacing query with cquery as underlying implementation ([#21567](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21567), [#13847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13847)).\r\n* The scheme for generating canonical repository names has changed to improve cacheability of actions across dependency version updates. Note that canonical names are not considered to be public API and can change at any time. See https://bazel.build/external/module#repository_names_and_strict_deps for advice on how to avoid hardcoding canonical repository names. ([#21316](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21316))\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20977](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20977))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n* Make Bazel's RAM estimate container aware ([#20644](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20644))\r\n    * On Linux, Bazel's RAM estimate for the host machine is now aware of container resource limits.\r\n    * On macOS, Bazel no longer consistently overestimates the total RAM by ~5% (`1024^2/1000^2`). \r\n    * On Windows, Bazel's RAM estimate is now generally more accurate as it is no longer influenced by JVM heuristics.\r\n* Added a new --experimental_execution_log_compact_file flag to produce an execution log in a leaner format and with less runtime overhead. The //src/tools/execlog:converter tool may be used to convert it into one of the preexisting --execution_log_{json,binary}_file formats.\r\n* Reduced the execution phase overhead for actions that create tree artifacts with a very large number of files (tens or hundreds of thousands).\r\n* Made sandboxing and sandboxed workers faster. This is achieved by deleting files asynchronously, reusing runfiles, reducing copying and not stashing unnecessary tmp directories.\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n* Fixed --incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules to work with targets at the top level (e.g. \"//:foo\") ([#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773#issuecomment-1852313089))\r\n* Minimum rules_python version increased from 0.4.0 to 0.22.1\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* Bazel now respects `expires` from Credential Helpers. ([#21429](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21429))\r\n\r\nRefer to the [full list of commits](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/compare/7.0.2...7.1.0rc1) for more details.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Alessandro Patti, Artem V.

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Fix tree file materialized as symlink to another file when building without the bytes. ([#20409](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20409))\r\n* Fix bootstrapped Bazel binary ([#20804](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20804))\r\n* Ignore read-only errors when updating the `mtime` of the `install_base` ([#20568](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20568))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Fix versioned shared libraries for macOS toolchain ([#20847](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20847))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Flip --incompatible_visibility_private_attributes_at_definition ([#20520](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20520))\r\n* Implemented --incompatible_enable_proto_toolchain_resolution ([#20925](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20925))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Fix extraction of tar archives containing sparse files. ([#20531](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20531))\r\n* Restart at most once when prepopulating repository rule environment ([#20667](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20667))\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n* Don't pass --add-opens= to javac ([#20472](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20472))\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* RemoteSpawnRunner: record inbetween phases in timing profile ([#20550](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20550))\r\n* Add profiling to `remoteActionBuildingSemaphore.acquire()` ([#20549](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20549))\r\n* Add flag `experimental_throttle_remote_action_building` ([#20861](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20861))\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build API\r\n* Various methods and fields related to labels and repos are deprecated in favor of new options with clearer naming and intent. The deprecated APIs can be disabled by setting `--noincompatible_enable_deprecated_label_apis`. ([#20590](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/20590))\r\n    * `native.repository_name()` is deprecated in favor of the new `native.repo_name()`.\r\n    * `Label.workspace_name` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.repo_name`.\r\n    * `Label.relative()` is deprecated in favor of the new `Label.same_package_label()` alongside the existing \r\n    * `native.package_relative_label()` and `Label()`.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements:\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Fabian Meumertzheim, Jordan Mele, Rahul Butani, and Son Luong Ngoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

See the [Bzlmod migration guide](http://bazel.build/external/migration) for more information.\r\n* Bazel now starts executing actions while it is still analyzing other top-level targets (Project Skymeld).\r\n  * This reduces end-to-end wall time for multi-target builds by up to 15%.\r\n* Platform-based toolchain resolution is now enabled for Android and C++. \r\n  * Android rules now use platforms and toolchains to control the target devices.. Android projects will need to stop passing the legacy flag `--fat_apk_cpu`, and instead use `--android_platforms` using platforms defined with the `@platforms//os:android` constraint. The https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android repository defines four standard Android platforms for projects that use those rules, `@rules_android//:armeabi-v7a`, `@rules_android//:arm64-v8a`, `@rules_android//:x86`, `@rules_android//:x86_64`. Full details are available in [the Android Platforms announcement](https://blog.bazel.build/2023/11/15/android-platforms.html).\r\n* Build without the Bytes (BwoB) is now enabled by default (`--remote_download_outputs` now defaults to `toplevel`). \r\n  * This reduces the number of downloaded artifacts when using remote caching and execution significantly, speeding up builds by up to 40%. \r\n  * This mode also enables Bazel to gracefully handle remote cache evictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Migration-Ready Incompatible Flags\r\nPrepare for future Bazel changes by using the following incompatible flags for early migration:\r\n* --[incompatible_auto_exec_groups](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17134)\r\n* --incompatible_disable_non_executable_java_binary\r\n* --[incompatible_disallow_struct_provider_syntax](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19467) \r\n* --[incompatible_disable_target_provider_fields](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19466)\r\n* --[incompatible_struct_has_no_methods](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19465)\r\n* --[incompatible_stop_exporting_language_modules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19455)\r\n* --[incompatible_disallow_empty_glob](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8195)\r\n* --[incompatible_disable_starlark_host_transitions](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17032)\r\n* --[incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933)\r\n\r\nAlready flipped and will be removed at head:\r\n* --incompatible_no_attr_license\r\n* --[incompatible_disable_objc_library_transition](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19688) \r\n* --[incompatible_fail_on_unknown_attributes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19403)\r\n* --incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution\r\n* --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view\r\n* --incompatible_always_check_depset_elements\r\n* --incompatible_visibility_private_attributes_at_definition\r\n* --incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs\r\n\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Many flags have been removed as part of the effort to remove and clean up unused flags (see the appendix for a full list; also [#19296](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/19296)).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_check_sharding_support` is enabled by default. Sharded tests with test runners that do not properly advertise support for test sharding will fail. Refer to [#18339](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18339) for migration advice.\r\nBazel’s embedded JVM has been upgraded to JDK 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The flag --android_include_proguard_location_references is removed and --no_proguard_location_reference is now added unconditionally to the command line of aapt2.\r\n* Updated Android manifest merger to v30.1.3.\r\n* Dropped support for legacy (pre-D8) desugaring.\r\n* Added support for optimizers rewriting baseline profiles.\r\n* Android resources will no longer propagate through neverlinked libraries by default.\r\n* Set Android Databinding to v2 and Databinding AndroidX to true and remove support for Databinding V1.\r\n\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Added a new flag `--incompatible_use_host_features`. When this flag is enabled, `--features` only applies to targets built in the target configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec configuration\r\n* **[Incompatible]** C++ rules use platform-based toolchain resolution (`--incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution` is now on). See [#7260](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Remove 'darwin' as a CPU value, use 'darwin_x86_64' instead\r\n* **[Incompatible]** cc_binary targets with dynamic_deps attributes no longer link indirect dynamic_deps on Unix. This might be an incompatible change if you are using RUNPATHs (instead of RPATHs) in your cc_shared_librarys. Enable the feature exclude_bazel_rpaths_in_transitive_libs or use_rpath_instead_of_runpath for those cc_shared_librarys.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `cc_host_toolchain_alias` rule is deleted. Please use `cc_toolchain_alias` rule instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Removed apple_crosstool_transition. Use transition_support.apple_rule_transition from rules_apple instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` preprocessor variable, which holds the canonical name of the Bazel repository containing a `cc_*` target, is now only set during compilation if the target depends on the C/C++ runfiles library `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles` via `deps` or `implementation_deps`.\r\n* C++ rules on Windows calling cc_common.create_linking_context_from_compilation_outputs check whether each target of the rule type should produce a dynamic library. This check used to be part of cc_common API, but is now moved to the caller rules instead.\r\n* C++ branch coverage is now enabled if gcov version is 8 or newer.\r\n* cc_shared_library is no longer experimental, see [#16709](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16709) for details\r\n* cc_test can now be configured by using a native.toolchain()\r\n* `objc_library` now produces better error messages while expanding make variables.\r\n* Unexpected C/C++ absolute includes now result in more descriptive error messages for unexpected cc absolute includes. They are not reported anymore reported as \"undeclared inclusion(s)\"\r\n* Compilation actions using the auto-configured MSVC toolchain are forced to emit error messages in English if the English language pack for Visual Studio is installed.\r\n* Fixed includes attribute of `objc_library` when sibling repository layout is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The flag `--extra_execution_platforms` no longer accumulates values over multiple specifications. To use multiple execution platforms, set `--extra_execution_platforms=platform1,platform2` instead of `--extra_execution_platforms=platform1 --extra_execution-platforms=platform2`.  The former registers both `platform1` and `platform2` while the latter overrides `platform1` with `platform2`. \r\n* **[Incompatible]** `copy_from_rule` on exec_group is deprecated ([#17668](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17668)).\r\n[Incompatible] `platform`, `constraint_setting`, and `constraint_value` no longer take an `applicable_licenses` value. Use package level defaults instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `default_package_metadata` doesn't apply to `platform`, `constraint_setting`, or `constraint_value` anymore. \r\n* **[Incompatible]** Duplicates in <rule-inputs> when using `query --output=xml --aspect_deps=precise` are removed.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Starlark API: removed outdated `ctx.host_fragments`, `ctx.host_configuration`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `genrule.exec_tools` is removed. Use `genrule.tools` instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `@bazel_tools//config:common_settings.bzl` has been removed. Use `@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl` instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_visibility_private_attributes_at_definition` is flipped to true. This supports prohibiting references to tools and `config_settings` used by internal rule logic. See [#19330](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19330).\r\n* The new flag `--use_target_platform_for_tests` allows one to execute tests with the target platform instead of the execution platform.\r\n* The new flag `--skip_incompatible_explicit_targets` can be used to skip incompatible targets even when explicitly requested on the command line. This changes the default behavior of reporting an error in this case. See https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#when-targets-skipped.\r\n* Added flag `--proto:include_attribute_source_aspects` that will include a new field `source_aspect_name` to the `Attribute` message that indicates the source aspect that the attribute comes from.\r\n* `default_applicable_licenses` in `package()` now applies to the entire BUILD file, regardless of where in the BUILD that `package()` is called.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Core\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** When multiple --deleted_packages options are passed on the command line, they will be concatenated instead of the latest one taking effect.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** JVM options in environment variables JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS now do not get to the server anymore; use --host_jvm_args instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_disallow_unsound_directory_outputs` is enabled by default: actions are now forbidden from creating an output directory where a file was expected.\r\n* The location of rules that explicitly specify `generator_name` and/or `generator_function` attributes (typically because they are incidentally copied from [`native.existing_rule()`](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/toplevel/native#existing_rule)) is now the top-level call in the `BUILD` file, which is consistent with rules that do not explicitly specify these attributes.\r\n* Warnings (most notably those associated with the [`deprecation` rule attribute](https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#common-attributes)) are no longer replayed on subsequent invocations unless the target in question is re-analyzed. Warnings are purely informational, so this change has no bearing on the correctness of the build. Downstream tests that break due to this change should update their expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** All labels in Bazel error messages, log output, Build Event Protocol, etc. are now prefixed with double-at (`@@`) instead of single-at (`@`) where applicable, to properly denote that they contain canonical repo names.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The attribute `new_local_repository.build_file` no longer accepts a path; a label must be passed instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `--experimental_repository_cache_urls_as_default_canonical_id` flag is no longer available. Instead, the `http_archive`, `http_file`, `http_jar`, `jvm_maven_import_external`, and `jvm_import_external` repository rules now use the URLs as the canonical ID if none is provided explicitly. If this behavior is not desired, it can be disabled via `--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Toolchains and execution platforms are now registered in the following order with --enable_bzlmod:\r\n   1. root module’s module file\r\n   2. WORKSPACE (or WORKSPACE.bzlmod if present)\r\n   3. non-root modules’ module files\r\n   4. default toolchains registered by Bazel (does not apply with WORKSPACE.bzlmod or execution platforms)\r\n* Bzlmod lockfile is enabled by default (--lockfile_mode defaults to update).\r\n* Added a new `max_compatibility_level` attribute to the `bazel_dep` directive, which allows version selection to upgrade a dependency up to the specified compatibility level.\r\n* Bazel now throws an error if the root module specifies overrides on nonexistent modules.\r\n* Added support for a new directive `use_repo_rule` in MODULE.bazel files, which allows you to conveniently declare repos that are only visible within your module.\r\n* --experimental_repository_disable_download is now promoted to stable and is also available under the name --repository_disable_download.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The deprecated fields transitive_deps, transitive_runtime_deps are dropped from JavaInfo\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The --experimental_java_proto_library_default_has_services command line option and the Starlark symbol java_common.experimental_java_proto_library_default_has_services function are not available anymore.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** java_test no longer produces deploy jars.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** JavaInfo.java_outputs.source_jars now returns a Depset. See [#18966](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18966).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Java toolchains rules are moved from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk` to rules_java ([#18558](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18558)), please switch to using the rules from `@rules_java`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Java runtime toolchains created via `local_java_repository` from `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:local_java_repository.bzl`, which includes `local_jdk`, now have `target_compatible_with` set to the auto-detected host constraints. This can result in errors about toolchain resolution failures for `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:runtime_toolchain_type`, especially when cross-compiling. These failures can be fixed in the following ways (listed in decreasing order of preference):\r\n  * Replace `java_binary` targets that aren't meant to be run with `bazel run` or as tools during the build with `java_single_jar` (available in `@rules_java//java:java_single_jar.bzl`). Such targets do not require a Java runtime for the target configuration.\r\n  * Set `--java_runtime_version=remotejdk_N` for some Java version `N` to let Bazel choose and download an appropriate remote JDK for the current target platform. This setting defaults to `local_jdk`, which means that Bazel can only use the local JDK, which isn't compatible with any other platform.\r\n  * Manually define and register a `local_java_runtime` with no value set for `exec_compatible_with` (defaults to `[]`) and select it by setting `--java_runtime_version` to its `name`. This fully restores the previous behavior, but can result in incorrect results when cross-compiling (see [#18265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18265)).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The moving of some rules and providers from native to Starlark changes the output of the providers function with cquery. (see [#20473](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/20473))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Bazel's local CPU resource on Linux is now container aware. Use `--local_cpu_resources`, `--loading_phase_threads` or `--jobs` to override.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The sandboxfs sandboxing strategy has been removed. It hadn't been maintained for a long time, it didn't work for most users and it was not consistently faster while being complex to set up.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** High priority workers functionality has been removed as we have not seen faster builds in scenarios they have been designed for.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` is enabled by default.\r\n* Directories used by sandboxed non-worker execution may be reused to avoid unnecessary setup costs. This behavior can be disabled with --noreuse_sandbox_directories.\r\n* Symlink trees created by sandboxing will be deleted asynchronously. This behavior can be disabled with --experimental_sandbox_async_tree_delete_idle_threads=0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Fixed spitting out multiple “Build completed” messages, and made them subject to filtering with `--ui_event_filters`. This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful builds from `FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully (0 packages loaded)` to `ERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** JSON profile: Counter series are now doubles instead of strings.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--experimental_execution_graph_log` no longer exists. Current users that want local logs need to pass `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log --experimental_execution_graph_log_path=/some/local/path`. Current users that want logs uploaded to BEP need to pass `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --experimental_genquery_use_graphless_query is now a NO-OP.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Changes to --execution_log_{json,binary}_file:\r\n  * Outputs are now correctly populated when building without the bytes\r\n  * Action digest is now correctly populated in cache hits\r\n  * The redundant progress_message and walltime fields have been removed\r\n  * The remote_cache_hit field is now called cache_hit, as it’s also set for disk cache hits\r\n  * Log sorting may now be disabled by setting --noexecution_log_sort\r\n  * It’s no longer possible to simultaneously request both execution log formats\r\n  * The --experimental_execution_log_spawn_metrics flag has been removed; the spawn metrics are now unconditionally set\r\n  * The --experimental_execution_log_file flag has been removed; use --execution_log_binary_file together with --noexecution_log_sort\r\n* Add `aquery --output=streamed_proto` which writes a stream of length delimited ActionGraphContainer containing a single Artifact, Action, Target, DepSetOfFiles, Configuration, AspectDescriptor, RuleClass, PathFragment proto. This breaks up the ActionGraphContainer into multiple ones which will prevent large protos from crashing Bazel.\r\n* (BEP) TargetConfigured events will be marked aborted instead of published when there is an analysis error. This is motivated by a low level Blaze change aimed at improving scalability.\r\n* The new `--consistent_labels` option on `query`, `cquery`, and `aquery` can be used to force consistent label formatting across all output modes that is also compatible with `str(Label(...))` in Starlark.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --experimental_build_transitive_python_runfiles is flipped to false. Setting it to true is no longer supported. See #16303 for details\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --incompatible_python_disable_py2 is flipped to true. See [#17293](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17293) and [#15684](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15684) for details.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** py_transitions top-level has been removed.\r\n* The Python rules built into Bazel have been reimplemented in Starlark, which introduces a handful of incompatible edge cases. See [#15897](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15897) for details.\r\n  * The `stamp` attribute can no longer be a configurable (`select`-based) boolean value.\r\n  * The `legacy_create_init` attribute can no longer be a configurable (`select`-based) boolean value.\r\n  * In `cquery` commands, the PyInfo and PyRuntimeInfo provider names, as returned by the `providers()` function, have changed.\r\n  * For `py_test` to add the `requires-darwin` execution requirement, the Apple OS constraints (`@platforms//os:{ios,macos,tvos,watchos}`) must match. Setting the `--cpu` flag (e.g `--cpu=darwin_x86_64`) isn't sufficient.\r\n* The flags `--incompatible_python_disallow_native_rules` and `--python_native_rules_allowlist` have been added to aid migrating code from using the builtin Bazel Python rules to using rules_python. See [#17773](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17773) for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Building without the bytes is now the default (i.e., `--remote_download_outputs` defaults to `toplevel`, meaning that only the outputs of top-level targets and those required by local actions will be downloaded). To download additional outputs, use `--remote_download_regex`. To revert to downloading all outputs, set `--remote_download_all`.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** When an incremental build fails because one or more blobs were evicted from the disk/remote cache, Bazel will now exit with exit code 39. Set `--experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries` to automatically retry the build in this case.\r\n* Add flags `--experimental_remote_cache_lease_extension` and `--experimental_remote_cache_ttl`, defaulting to 3 hours, allowing Bazel to automatically extend leases on remote cache blobs while a build is in progress\r\n* `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload` has been renamed to `--remote_build_event_upload`.\r\n* `--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata` has been renamed to `--action_cache_store_output_metadata`.\r\n* Changed the default value for `--remote_build_event_upload` to `minimal`.\r\n* `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` has been renamed to `--remote_cache_compression`.\r\n* `--experimental_remote_grpc_log` has been renamed to `--remote_grpc_log`.\r\n* `--incompatible_remote_build_event_upload_respect_no_cache` is now a no-op.\r\n* Non-ASCII arguments are now correctly written to parameter files instead of as mojibake.\r\n* --remote_download_minimal no longer implies --nobuild_runfile_links.\r\n* –remote_download_{toplevel,minimal} no longer imply --experimental_inmemory_{jdeps,dotd}_files, which now default to true.\r\n* `--zip_undeclared_test_outputs` now preserves symlinks when zipping `$TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `cmd_helper` module has been removed.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `ctx.new_file` has been removed; `ctx.actions.declare_file` is to be used instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** proto_compiler attribute removed from proto_lang_toolchain (it was recently introduced, and there is no evidence of use)\r\n* **[Incompatible]** testing.analysis_test is not experimental anymore.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Non-existent rule attributes can not be set anymore, not even to None. See [#19403](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19403).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** --incompatible_merge_fixed_and_default_shell_env is flipped to true. See [#19317](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19317) for details.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The rule function now takes only the implementation function positionally; other parameters have to be named.\r\n* Double value positive infinity is now correctly encoded as \"inf\" instead of \"+inf\" for textprotos.\r\n* json.decode now takes an optional `default` parameter; if this parameter is specified and decoding fails, json.decode will return the `default` value instead of failing Starlark evaluation.\r\n* starlark_doc_extract is enabled. It's a native rule for Starlark documentation extraction. This rule is intended mainly for internal use by Stardoc.\r\n* `rule()` and `attr.*` can no longer be (pointlessly) called during WORKSPACE evaluation and repository rule evaluation.\r\n* attr objects in Starlark now use value equality rather than reference equality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Appendix: Removed flags\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The following flags are removed as part of the effort to remove and clean up

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Ensure that extension unique names followed by `~` are prefix-free ([#19167](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19167))\r\n* Module extensions can now specify a list of environment variables to watch through the [environ](https://bazel.build/rules/lib/globals/bzl#module_extension.environ) parameter.\r\n* The module lockfile can now deal with missing fields due to Bazel version upgrades. ([#19175](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19175))\r\n* Module extensions are now re-evaluated if any labels they depend on change, similar to repo rules. ([#19175](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19175))\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

Release 6.3.1 (2023-07-31)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:**  0f231ac8acabcd8aa309da041c98ab90a1552418\r\n\r\nBazel 6.3.1 is a patch LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Disabled lockfile support by default due to issue reports ([#19105](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19105) and [#19068](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19068)). Will be re-enabled in the next minor release.\r\n* Mark isolated extension usages as experimental ([#19050](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19050))\r\n* Fix a bug where frozen targets list was mutated while expanding env attribute ([#19052](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/19052))\r\n* Advertise CcInfo from cc_import ([#19086](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19086))\r\n* Update java_tools to v12.6 ([#19091](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/19091))\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones and Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

 758b44dab552f31b378874b5bf4c0609bfef6f5d\r\n\r\nBazel 6.3.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* The new bazel mod command allows users to inspect their external dependency graph in Bzlmod. See [documentation](https://bazel.build/versions/6.3.0/external/mod-command) for details.\r\n* Full lockfile support has been added to Bzlmod and is now enabled by default.

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* Fix bazel run test_target exit code issue (#[18512](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18512))\r\n* Use extension rather than local names in ModuleExtensionMetadata ([#18535](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18535))\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

d60ce2c7c86393638c77698c00c2168a7a936a53\r\n\r\nBazel 6.2.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* Added preliminary support for a lockfile for Bzlmod. It's disabled by default; use `--lockfile_mode=update` to enable it. Check flag documentation [here](https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--lockfile_mode). This lockfile contains only Bazel module information; it does not involve module extensions. ([#18143](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18143))\r\n\r\n## General\r\n* `@foo` labels can now be used on the command line as the top-level target (that is, `bazel build @foo` now works). Double-dot syntax is now forbidden (`bazel build ../foo` will no longer work). ([#17945](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17945))\r\n* The aquery and cquery commands now respect the --query_file flag just like the query command. ([#17823](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17823))\r\n* Patch zlib to fix compatibility with latest Xcode ([#18000](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18000))\r\n* profile: add profile_finish_ts ([#18129](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18129))\r\n* Use ctime in file digest cache key ([#18105](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18105))\r\n* Include cause when reporting `ActionExecutionException` ([#18185](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18185))\r\n* Check for the nullness of `AspectValue`. ([#18186](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18186))\r\n* Force the Bazel server Java runtime to use the root locale ([#17733](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17733))\r\n* Fix message generation of `ActionExecutionException` ([#18257](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18257))\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n* Added coverage metric support to android_local_test ([#17467](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17467))\r\n* Include build-tools/X.Y.Z/{lib,lib64}/** in the minimal set of SDK files used by the Android integration tests. ([#17826](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17826))\r\n* Fix worker and multiplex workers for DexBuilder and Desugar actions ([#17965](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17965))\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n* Fix wasm dynamic library extension crash ([#17765](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17765))\r\n* Enable C++ deps pruning on Windows when PARSE_SHOWINCLUDES is available. ([#17957](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17957))\r\n* Add attribute provides = [CcInfo] to _cc_proto_aspect ([#17979](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17979))\r\n* Expose cc_proto_aspect as a top level symbol. ([#17980](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17980))\r\n\r\n## CLI\r\n* Handle `SIGWINCH` under `bazel run //some:test` (i.e. test rules) correctly. ([#17760](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17760))\r\n* Use less subshells and `tee`s in running tests with `bazel run`. ([#17869](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17869))\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n* Allow multiple matching select branches if they resolve to the same value ([#18066](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18066))\r\n* cquery --output-starlark: better alias support ([#17786](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17786))\r\n* Fix crashes on select()able target_compatible_with attributes. ([#18135](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18135))\r\n* Add \"did you mean?\" suggestions for typoed rule attribute names ([#17855](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17855))\r\n* Turn applicable_licenses on platform() into a no-op. ([#18089](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18089))\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* Added `native.module_name()` and `native.module_version()` to allow BUILD macro authors to acquire information about which Bazel module the current repo is associated with. ([#17893](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17893))\r\n* Added a new `max_compatibility_level` attribute to the `bazel_dep` directive, which allows version selection to upgrade a dependency up to the specified compatibility level. ([#18178](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18178))\r\n* Added `module_ctx.is_dev_dependency`, allowing an extension to see whether a tag is specified to be a dev dependency. ([#17934](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17934))\r\n* Added `module_ctx.extension_metadata`, allowing the extension to specify the list of repos the root module can `use_repo` on. If the root module violates this list, Bazel will print out a Buildozer command to automatically fix the use_repo directive. ([#18174](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18174))\r\n* Fixed an issue where WORKSPACE and WORKSPACE-loaded .bzl files couldn't see the Bzlmod root module's mappings when Bzlmod is enabled. ([#17818](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17818))\r\n* Added suggestions to invalid tag class errors. ([#17896](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/17896))\r\n* Workspace relative paths are now supported in --override_module.

Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`. The binaries and source-code of the bundled OpenJDK can be [downloaded from our mirror server](https://mirror.bazel.build/openjdk/index.html).\r\n\r\n_Security_: All our binaries are signed with our

It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 6.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n* Patch zlib to fix compatibility with Xcode 14.3 ([#18039](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18039))\r\n* Use ctime in file digest cache key ([#18101](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18101))\r\n* Turn applicable_licenses on platforms into a no-op ([#18082](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/18082))\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Fabian Meumertzheim.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception. Those installers should always be redistributed along with the source code.\r\n\r\nSome versions of Bazel contain a bundled version of OpenJDK. The license of the bundled OpenJDK and other open-source components can be displayed by running the command `bazel license`. The vendor and version information of the bundled OpenJDK can be displayed by running the command `bazel info java-runtime`.

6.0 is a major LTS release. It contains new features and backwards incompatible changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* [Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/build/bzlmod), the new external dependency system in Bazel, is now generally available (though still disabled by default). Use `--enable_bzlmod` to enable it.\r\n* Toolchain types may now be [optional](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/extending/toolchains#optional-toolchains), in addition to mandatory.\r\n* The author of a `.bzl` file can now call [`visibility()`](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/rules/lib/globals#visibility) to declare a [load visibility](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/concepts/visibility#load-visibility) for that file. Load visibility is a new concept that governs which other `.bzl` and `BUILD` files may load `.bzl` code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `genrule` is switched to use exec transition instead of host. This can break targets with hardcoded output paths. To avoid using hardcoded paths use make variables, see [Predefined source/output path variables](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/reference/be/make-variables#predefined_label_variables).\r\n* The Build Event Protocol now contains file digests and sizes along with the file name and URI.\r\n* Introduced a new canonical label literal syntax `@@canonical_repo_name//foo:bar` that skips repository mapping. When Bzlmod is enabled, calling `str()` on a Label object will return literals of this form.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Added a new flag `--incompatible_unambiguous_label_stringification` (defaults to `true`), which causes labels in the main repo to stringify into unambiguous forms starting with an `@`. ([#15916](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15916))\r\n* The [`some` function in `query`]([https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/query/language#some](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/query/language#some)) now contains an optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of targets to return.\r\n* Bazel no longer increases the delay between progress updates when there is no cursor control.(https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16119)\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* D8 is used for dexing and Java 8 desugaring.\r\n* Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the Android SDK.\r\n* D8 dependency updated to v. 3.3.28.\r\n* Worker mode for D8 desugaring and dexing is supported.\r\n* `--persistent_multiplex_android_tools` added to enable persistent multiplex workers for Android resource processing, dexing, and desugaring.\r\n* Merging \"uses-permissions\" tags in Android manifests available with `--merge_android_manifest_permissions`\r\n* Start of DX removal: Migrate `main_dex_list_creator` to D8.\r\n* Deleted the `--extra_proguard_specs` Blaze flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Apple / Xcode\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Bazel now matches remote and local xcode versions by the most granular version.\r\n* Introduced an experimental static library linking API under `apple_common.link_multi_arch_static_library`.\r\n* Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage reports ([#14969](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14969)).\r\n\r\n\r\n## C++ / Objective-C\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Bazel no longer stamps `cc_common.link` actions for tool dependencies.\r\n* Switched `cc_test`, `cc_binary` and `cc_library` implementations to Starlark. \r\n*  `cc_test` will now link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Split up the C++ archive from the C++ link action and set `CppArchive` as mnemonic.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `objc_library` now requires `CcInfo` in its deps.  If this breaks you, add empty `CcInfo()` to your rule.\r\n* The `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler` flag now has the value `gcc` if the configured compiler is detected to be gcc rather than the generic value `compiler`. A branch for `gcc` may have to be added to `select` statements that do not have a default case that handles gcc appropriately.\r\n* The `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler` flag now has the value `clang` for the auto-configured Xcode toolchain rather than the generic value `compiler`. A branch for `clang` may have to be added to select statements that do not have a default case that handles this toolchain appropriately.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `include_prefix` and `strip_include_prefix` for cc rules will no longer accept an empty string (see [code](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/d876b6a7b0b097d47cea7b895f08d11b79b43485/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/cpp/CcModule.java#L2545)); use a dot instead. ([#17039](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17039))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configurability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* `cquery`'s new [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output) lists the output files that targets produce.\r\n* [`genquery.scope`](https://bazel.build/reference/be/general#genquery.scope) is [faster]([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e3f319e19dc4e828c78b76cab8aaea3f38b488e8](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/e3f319e19dc4e828c78b76cab8aaea3f38b488e8)).\r\n* New `--experimental_output_directory_naming_scheme=diff_against_baseline` [may]([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14023#issuecomment-1093216554](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14023#issuecomment-1093216554)) improve build speed for builds that use [transitions]([https://bazel.build/extending/config#user-defined-transitions](https://bazel.build/extending/config#user-defined-transitions)).\r\n* [Incompatible target skipping](https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets) [works](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14867) when dependencies lack platform-appropriate toolchains.\r\n* Enable `--use_top_level_targets_for_symlinks` so targets with [transitions]([https://bazel.build/extending/config#user-defined-transitions](https://bazel.build/extending/config#user-defined-transitions)) are more likely to appear in `bazel-out/…/bin`.\r\n* `bazel config` now only reports info from the last build. To compare configurations across multiple builds, redirect `bazel config` output to a file and run your favorite diff tool.\r\n* `cquery` proto formatted output now includes more information about configurations. This deprecates the `configuration` field of `AnalysisProtosV2.ConfiguredTarget`, and adds a new field, `configuration_id`, to be used instead.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** [`--incompatible_override_toolchain_transition`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11584) is now always set and will be removed in the future. `--noincompatible_override_toolchain_transition` has no effect and the value of the `incompatible_use_toolchain_transition` parameter in `aspect()` and `rule()` builtins is ignored.\r\n* [`select()`](https://bazel.build/docs/configurable-attributes): improved support for [`constraint_value`]([https://bazel.build/reference/be/platform#constraint_value](https://bazel.build/reference/be/platform#constraint_value)) with new [alias](https://bazel.build/reference/be/general#alias) and [specialization](https://bazel.build/reference/be/functions#select) support\r\n* [`select()`]([https://bazel.build/docs/configurable-attributes](https://bazel.build/docs/configurable-attributes)) [no longer]([https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/2570fe1119b2462ba10790d3bedf53699baecdf5](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/2570fe1119b2462ba10790d3bedf53699baecdf5) ) reports inaccurate \"Duplicate label\" errors.\r\n* Bazel now correctly configures shell actions for multiplatform builds.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** [` --incompatible_use_platforms_repo_for_constraints`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8622) is now always set and will be removed in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--noincompatible_disable_managed_directories`, and with that, `workspace(managed_directories=)` is not supported anymore.\r\n* The `get_child` method of `path` now accepts an arbitrary number of relative path strings as positional arguments.\r\n* The `new_git_repository` repository rule has been deprecated in favor of `git_repository`. ([#16064](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16064))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Java\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Packaging support for deploy JAR embedded JDK files (hermetic Java).\r\n* Make `ijar` / `java_import` preserve classes with `@kotlin.Metadata` annotations.\r\n* Singlejar accepts runtime `Created-By` field.\r\n* Change singlejar metadata to report `Created-By` Bazel.\r\n* Record hermetic packaged JDK modules file size in deploy JAR manifest `JDK-Lib-Modules-Size` attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Local Execution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Made multiple improvements to dynamic execution to manage local machine resources: `--experimental_dynamic_exclude_tools`, `--experimental_dynamic_load_factor`, support for ignoring certain errors in one branch, and better prioritization of local-only actions.\r\n* Fixed a race condition in dynamic execution that caused occasional crashes.\r\n* The Linux sandbox can now run in a chroot jail only allowing access to allowlisted directories ([#13279](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/13279))\r\n* Added more data to the profile: system load average (`--experimental_collect_load_average_in_profiler`), worker memory usage (`--experimental_collect_worker_data_in_profiler`), system network usage (`--experimental_collect_system_network_usage`), and system CPU/memory metrics.\r\n* Added option to include spawn metrics in execution log (`--experimental_execution_log_spawn_metrics`)\r\n* It is now possible to use pseudoterminals in the Linux sandbox ([#14072](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14072))\r\n* Added the `--incompatible_sandbox_hermetic_tmp` flag that makes sandboxed actions have separate `/tmp` directories (Linux only). ([#16336](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16336))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Packaging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Further deprecation and removal of `pkg_tar`. Stop supporting legacy use of `files` attribute, where it could be a list of labels instead of a map of paths to labels.\r\n* Removed `--incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg` flag. It never fulfilled its purpose because `--all_incompatible_changes` would never set it. The last rule it gated (`pkg_tar`) is scheduled to be removed in Bazel 6.x.\r\n* `pkg_tar(symlinks)` has been removed. Users needing that feature should migrate to `@rules_pkg`.\r\n* Remove `mtime` options from `pkg_tar`. Users should migrate to `@rules_pkg`.\r\n* The legacy `pkg_tar` no longer supports the ability to untar and repackage an input tar file (`deps` attribute). Users needing that capability must switch to `rules_pkg`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Persistent Workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Added support for remote persistent workers ([#16362](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16362))\r\n* Added `--experimental_worker_multiplex_sandboxing` flag that controls whether to sandbox multiplex workers that support it.\r\n* Added `--experimental_total_worker_memory_limit_mb` flag that enables evicting idle workers when workers use too much memory.\r\n* Added `--experimental_worker_as_resource` that prevents creation of workers before they have the resources to run.\r\n* Added verbosity field to worker protocol for better debugging.\r\n* Added `--experimental_worker_strict_flagfiles` flag that makes improper use of @-files in worker definitions a failure.\r\n* Worker directories are now only created when actually needed.\r\n* Made the JSON worker protocol newline-delimited ([#14219](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/14219))\r\n* The worker JSON protocol now ignores unknown fields.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Flag `--experimental_worker_allow_json_protocol` removed (defaulted to true).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Python\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Add `six` to deps of `has_services=1` `py_proto_library`s.\r\n* Add `--incompatible_build_transitive_python_runfiles` alias. ([#16303](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16303)). **This will be enabled next release**.\r\n* Added `CurrentRepository` method to `bazel_tools` Python runfiles library for Bzlmod support ([#16341](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16341)).\r\n* Make `--incompatible_disallow_legacy_py_provider` a no-op; using the modern `PyInfo` provider is now always required.\r\n* Remove potentially misleading warning about potential Python version mismatch ([#15783](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15783)).\r\n* Reduce import overhead during bootstrapping ([#15572](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15572)).\r\n* Set `PYTHONSAFEPATH` to prevent escaping runfiles ([#15701](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15701)).\r\n* Allow larger transitive dependencies by deduplicating `PYTHONPATH` ([#15648](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15648)).\r\n* Optimize memory usage when building Python zip files ([#15037](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15037)).\r\n* Fix: `py_test` now collect coverage for C++ binaries in data ([#15098](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15098)).\r\n* Fix: Allow spaces in Windows path to binary ([#14851](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14851)).\r\n* Fix: Allow Windows launcher to customize executable name ([#14343](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14343)).\r\n* Fix: `py_binary` can now be invoked through an `sh_binary` ([#11997](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11997)).\r\n* Various preparations to drop Python 2 support and re-implement rules in Starlark ([#15684](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15684), [#15897](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15897)).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Remote Execution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.\r\n* The deprecated `--remote_allow_symlink_upload` flag has been removed. Symlinks in local action outputs are always permitted, even with remote caching. Whether they're uploaded as symlinks or as the files/directories they point to is still determined by the `--incompatible_remote_symlinks` flag.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers` is flipped to `true`. ([#16356](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16356))\r\n* **[Incompatible]** GrpcRemoteDownloader only includes relevant headers instead of sending all credentials (see [security advisory](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/security/advisories/GHSA-mxr8-q875-rhwq)).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `--incompatible_remote_results_ignore_disk` is flipped to `true`. ([#15148](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15148))\r\n* Improve `--remote_download_minimal` by correctly downloading necessary outputs for `bazel run` and `bazel test`.\r\n* Add flag `--experimental_remote_mark_tool_inputs` to support remote persistent workers.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** Deprecated flag `--remote_allow_symlink_upload` is deleted.\r\n* Add flag `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload` to control how Bazel upload local outputs referenced by BEP to remote cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Starlark / Build Language\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* `\\a \\b \\f \\v` escape sequences are now allowed in Starlark.\r\n* `provider()` now allows you to specify a custom constructor (`init`) for performing pre-processing and validation of field values. For more information, see [Custom initialization of providers](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/extending/rules#custom_initialization_of_providers).\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `--incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view` flag has been flipped to true. ([#13907](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13907))\r\n* Starlark test rules can use the new `inherited_environment` parameter of `testing.TestEnvironment` to specify environment variables whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.\r\n* Aspects can now define and use exec groups using the same API as rules.\r\n* **[Incompatible]** `analysis_test` moved into `testing.analysis_test`.\r\n* `SourceManifestAction` now supports `Action.content`.\r\n* Added `struct`, `json`, `proto`, and `depset` to the starlark environment of Bazel's cquery (--output=starlark) command\r\n* **[Incompatible]** The `name` parameter is removed from the `rule` function. ([#16301](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16301))\r\n* **[Incompatible]** In `package_group`'s `[packages](https://bazel.build/versions/6.0.0/reference/be/functions#package_group.packages)` attribute, the syntax `\"//...\"` now refers to all packages in the same repository as the package group, rather than all packages everywhere. The new item `\"public\"` can be used instead to obtain the old behavior. In `bazel query --output=proto` (and `--output=xml`), the `packages` attribute now serializes with the leading double slash included (for instance, `//foo/bar/...` instead of `foo/bar/...`). See issues [#16323](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16323), [#16355](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16355), and [#16391](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16391) for more information and for the flags to temporarily opt out of these changes.\r\n* `package(default_package_metadata=[...])` is now the preferred alternative to `default_applicable_liceneses`. `default_applicable_liceneses` will be removed in a future release.\r\n* Aspects can now have parameters of types: [integer](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/14292d176cb85d1cf6e20f79fde0249b0fe6ba24) and [boolean](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/30fd508bf68c8bb9cf32839b71f79a9aa4bd069a)\r\n* Command-line aspects can now have parameters of types: string, integer and boolean. `–aspects_parameters` flag is introduced to pass their values [[commit](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/37710728712e00e8bd7145662668d72591204146)].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Adam Azarchs, Adam Singer, Adam Wolf, Albert Lloveras, Alessandro Patti, Alex Eagle, Alex Scott, Alex Torok, Andreas Fuchs, Andreas Herrmann, Andrew Katson, Andrew Klotz, arun.sampathkumar, arunkumar9t2, Ast-x64, Benedek Thaler, Benjamin Lee, Benjamin Peterson, Bo Zhang, Bohdan Vanieiev, Bradley Burns, Brandon Duffany, Brandon Jacklyn, Brentley Jones, Chad Miller, Charles-Francois Natali, Chris Clearwater, Chris Fredrickson, Christopher Rydell, Christopher Sauer, ckiffel, Cristian Hancila, crydell-ericsson, Dan Fleming, Daniel Wagner-Hall, Danny Wolf, David Ostrovsky, David Sanderson, Denys Kurylenko, dhmemi, Dimi Shahbaz, divanorama, Ed Schouten, Emil Kattainen, Eric Song, Eric Wendelin, Fabian Brandstetter, Fabian Meumertzheim, Fredrik Medley, George Prekas, gkgoat1, gkorlam, Greg Roodt, Gregory Fong, Grzegorz Lukasik, Halil Sener, Hannes Kufler, homuler, Igor Nazarenko, James Broadhead, Jason Tan, Jay Bazuzi, Jeremy Volkman, jheaff1, Jiawen Chen, Joel Williamson, John Laxson, John Millikin, Jon Shea, Jonathan Gerrish, juanchoviedo, Kaiqin Chen, Keith Smiley, Ken Micklas, Kevin Lin, Kirill Zabelin, Kiron, Krishna Ersson, Krzysztof Naglik, lihu, Luc Bertrand, Luis Fernando Pino Duque, Marek uppa, Matt Clarkson, Matt Mackay, Michael P.

Release 5.4.0 (2022-12-15)\r\n\r\n**Baseline:** 8d66a4171baddcbe1569972f019e54130111202c\r\n\r\n**Release Notes**\r\nBazel 5.4.0 is a minor LTS release. It is fully backward compatible with Bazel 5.0 and contains selected changes by the Bazel community and Google engineers.\r\n\r\n- Added `rlocationpath(s)` functions suitable for the `Rlocation` function offered by runfiles libraries for smoother transition from Bazel 5.x.x to Bazel 6.0.0 ([#16668](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16668))\r\n- `package(default_package_metadata=[...])` is now the preferred alternative to `default_applicable_liceneses`. `default_applicable_liceneses` will be removed in a future release. ([#16892](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16892))\r\n- Fixed hanging issue when Bazel fails to upload action inputs. ([#16819](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16819))\r\n- Upgraded google-auth-library-oauth2-http dependencies and fixed transitive dependency on opencensus-contrib-http-util 0.31.0. ([#15639](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15639))\r\n- Fixed coverage generation for C++ when multiple files with the same name are present. ([#16672](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16672))\r\n- Moved analysis_test into testing.analysis_test, an experimental function intended to be used only by the rules_testing repository. The move makes it easier to support both Bazel 5.4.0 and Bazel 6.0.0. ([#16702](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16702))\r\n- Keep credentials obtained from a credential helper cached across build commands.([#16884](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16884))\r\n- Add 'toolchain' parameter to actions.{run,run_shell} ([#16964](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/16964))\r\n\r\n**Acknowledgements**\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Andreas Fuchs, Benjamin Peterson, Brentley Jones, Dan Fleming, Danny Wolf, Emil Kattainen, Fabian Meumertzheim, Juh-Roch, Keith Smiley, Krzysztof Naglik, Niyas Sait, Noa Resare, Oliver Eikemeier, Peter Mounce, Philipp Schrader, Ryan Beasley, Thi Doãn, Yannic, Zhongpeng Lin.\r\n\r\n_Notice_: Bazel installers contain binaries licensed under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception.
