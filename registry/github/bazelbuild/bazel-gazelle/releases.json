this release, Gazelle no longer resolves Go and proto imports of Google APIs to `@go_googleapis`. Instead, Go packages from Google APIs will be treated as regular Go packages, and resolve to `@org_golang_google_genproto`, which contains the pre-generated Go code, with its version determined by Go modules. For proto files importing Google APIs proto and generating Go code, users need to:\r\n\r\n1. Add an `http_archive` rule to download Google APIs, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"googleapis\",\r\n    sha256 = \"9d1a930e767c93c825398b8f8692eca3fe353b9aaadedfbcf1fca2282c85df88\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"googleapis-64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/archive/64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@googleapis//:repository_rules.bzl\", \"switched_rules_by_language\")\r\n\r\nswitched_rules_by_language(\r\n    name = \"com_google_googleapis_imports\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the version of Google APIs archive needs to be compatible with the pre-generated code in `@org_golang_google_genproto`.\r\n\r\n2. Resolve the proto manually. If Gazelle is being used, directives like the following need to be added to a parent directory of the proto files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto proto google/rpc/status.proto @googleapis//google/rpc:status_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/rpc/status.proto  @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/rpc/status\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto google/longrunning/operations.proto @googleapis//google/longrunning:operations_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/longrunning/operations.proto @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/longrunning\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Decouple Google APIs by @linzhp in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1561\r\n* resolve: Add a resolve_regexp directive by @DolceTriade in https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/pull/1542\r\n* Remove module dependency on go_googleapis by @linzhp in

Similarly, a test will be named `foo_test` instead of `go_default_test`.\r\n  * Gazelle will attempt to detect the naming convention used in existing projects, so it shouldn't unexpectedly change the naming convention.\r\n  * To specify the naming convention explicitly, use the `# gazelle:go_naming_convention` directive or the `-go_naming_convention` flag. Valid values are `import`, `go_default_library`, and `import_alias`. Gazelle will rename existing targets the next time it runs after a change.\r\n  * `go_repository` uses the `import_alias` naming convention by default, so either the old or new names may be used.\r\n  * Thanks to @tomlu for implementing this.\r\n* Added `# gazelle:go_generate_proto` directive, which instructs the Go extension whether to generate `go_proto_library` rules for `proto_library` generated by the proto extension (thanks @linzhp).\r\n* Improved Windows compatibility (thanks @tomlu).\r\n* Language extensions can now provide dependency resolution for other extensions by implementing the `resolve.CrossResolver` interface. This is now used for resolve proto imports in Go (thanks @blico).\r\n* In the `update-repos` command, the `-build_directives` flag may be used to set the `build_directives` attribute on generated repositories (thanks @Helcaraxan).\r\n* In the `update-repos` command, new rules and macros will be inserted higher in `WORKSPACE`, above `go_rules_dependencies` and `gazelle_dependencies` if possible, to make it easier to override indirect dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* `gazelle_binary` no longer supports mode attributes such as `goos`, `race`, and `gotags`. These depended on internal implementation details in rules_go. If you need to build a `gazelle_binary` for a platform other than the host, use command-line flags such as `--platforms` and `--@io_bazel_rules_go//go/config:race` or use a transition.\r\n\r\n## WORKSPACE code\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"bazel_gazelle\",\r\n    sha256 = \"d4113967ab451dd4d2d767c3ca5f927fec4b30f3b2c6f8135a2033b9c05a5687\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.22.0/bazel-gazelle-v0.22.0.tar.gz\",\r\n        \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.22.0/bazel-gazelle-v0.22.0.tar.gz\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@bazel_gazelle//:deps.bzl\", \"gazelle_dependencies\")\r\ngazelle_dependencies()\r\n```\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/26997379","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/26997379/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/26997379/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/tag/v0.21.1","id":26997379,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI2OTk3Mzc5","tag_name":"v0.21.1","target_commitish":"release-0.21","name":"v0.21.1","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2020-05-28T15:48:00Z","published_at":"2020-05-28T16:37:28Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/21147858","id":21147858,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDIxMTQ3ODU4","name":"bazel-gazelle-v0.21.1.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1541328,"download_count":3714616,"created_at":"2020-05-28T15:51:18Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T15:51:20Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/v0.21.1/bazel-gazelle-v0.21.1.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/tarball/v0.21.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/zipball/v0.21.1","body":"## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed visibility for Go libraries in `internal` directories.

General changes\r\n\r\n* The `# gazelle:repository` directive is now supported in WORKSPACE files. Gazelle will behave as if a repository rule were declared with the given kind and attributes. This may override other declared rules. This is useful for declaring rules that appear in other files and can't be managed with `#gazelle:repository_macro`. Thanks to @blico.\r\n* The `update-repos` command now accepts versions for each argument, for example, `update-repos github.com/sirupsen/logrus@v1.4.0`. For Go, the version suffixes follow the same format that `go get` accepts in module mode. Thanks to @weixiao-huang.\r\n\r\n## Go changes\r\n\r\n* `go_repository` has better support for visibility across submodules. For example, `cloud.google.com/logging` may now depend on internal packages in `cloud.google.com`, when both modules are unmodified `go_repository` rules. Previously, this required `visibility` attributes to be patched into the parent module.\r\n* `go_repository` now handles WORKSPACE-based configuration more efficiently. A configuration file is derived from the relevant parts of WORKSPACE and any functions declared with `# gazelle:repository_macro`. `go_repository` rules are re-evaluated when the configuration file changes, not when WORKSPACE changes. Previously, non-Go-related changes to WORKSPACE would cause `go_repository` to be re-evaluated. Thanks to @blico.\r\n* `go_repository` now accepts a `build_directives` attribute, a list of directives to write into the root build file before running Gazelle. Thanks to @linzhp.\r\n* The `# gazelle:go_visibility` directive may be used to add labels to visibility attributes of Go rules.

Compatibility\r\n\r\n* `rules_go` 0.19.0 or later is now required. Older versions are not supported but may still work, depending on what features are needed.\r\n\r\n## General changes\r\n\r\n* `gazelle update-repos` now supports the flag `-to_macro=file.bzl%macro`. Instead of writing new repository rules to WORKSPACE, rules will be written to a function in a separate .bzl file. This helps keep related rules together. Thanks to @blico!\r\n* The directive `# gazelle:repository_macro file.bzl%macro` may be used in WORKSPACE to declare a macro generated with the above flag. `gazelle update-repos` will automatically update rules declared in the named macros instead of adding them to WORKSPACE. The directive may be repeated for multiple macros. `gazelle fix` and `gazelle update` will also read workspaces declared in these macros to find known repository roots and names. Thanks again to @blico!\r\n* The directive `# gazelle:exclude .` may now be written to skip updating the current directory and subdirectories. Previously, `exclude` only applied to files and subdirectories.\r\n\r\n## Go changes\r\n\r\n* [`go_repository`](/workspace.rst#go-repository) can now download modules. To download a module, set the `version` and `sum` attributes instead of `urls` (for HTTP) or `commit` or `tag` (for VCS downloads). `go_repository` will download and verify the specified module with `go mod download`. The environment variables `GOPROXY`, `GOPRIVATE`, `GONOPROXY`, `GOSUMDB`, and `GONOSUMDB` are observed, so be sure to set these for private modules when using go1.13 or later.\r\n* `gazelle update-repos <path>` will add or update `go_repository` rules in module mode.\r\n* `gazelle update-repos -from_file=go.mod` will also add or update rules in module mode.\r\n* Refactored infrastructure behind `go_repository`. There are now separate tools and cache workspaces. Modules are downloaded into the cache. When Gazelle is updated, it should not be necessary to re-download modules unless the implementation of the cache changes. The environment variable `GO_REPOSITORY_USE_HOST_CACHE` may be set to `1` to use `$GOPATH/pkg/mod` as a module cache instead of the cache workspace.\r\n* `go_repository` now provides a `replace` attribute in module mode, analogous to `replace` in a go.mod file. The `version` and `sum` attributes are used on the replacement, but build files will be generated with the `importpath` of the original module. `gazelle update-repos -from-file=go.mod` will add `replace` attributes automatically (thanks to @bigkraig!).\r\n* `gazelle update-repos` now supports the flag `-prune`, which may be used with `-from_file`. When enabled, Gazelle will remove `go_repository` rules that no longer have equivalent repos in go.mod or Gopkg.lock. Thanks to @blico!\r\n* When run by `go_repository`, Gazelle now supports [minimal module compatibility](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-are-v2-modules-treated-in-a-build-if-modules-support-is-not-enabled-how-does-minimal-module-compatibility-work-in-197-1103-and-111). For v2+ modules, Gazelle will generate `importpath_aliases` attributes so `go_libraries` may be imported without the semantic import version suffix by non-modularized packages.\r\n\r\n## Proto changes\r\n\r\n* Updated table of known proto import paths for consistency with rules_go 0.19.0.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/15814296","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/15814296/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/15814296/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/tag/0.17.0","id":15814296,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE1ODE0Mjk2","tag_name":"0.17.0","target_commitish":"release-0.17","name":"0.17.0","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2019-02-27T18:37:20Z","published_at":"2019-02-27T18:39:34Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/11272421","id":11272421,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDExMjcyNDIx","name":"bazel-gazelle-0.17.0.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1448141,"download_count":1543929,"created_at":"2019-02-27T18:39:22Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T18:39:23Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/0.17.0/bazel-gazelle-0.17.0.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/11272422","id":11272422,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDExMjcyNDIy","name":"bazel-gazelle-0.17.0.tar.gz.sha256","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":94,"download_count":157,"created_at":"2019-02-27T18:39:22Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T18:39:23Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/0.17.0/bazel-gazelle-0.17.0.tar.gz.sha256"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/tarball/0.17.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/zipball/0.17.0","body":"## Language agnostic changes\r\n\r\n* The `# gazelle:map_kind` directive can now be used to generate rules of\r\n  alternative kinds.

Thanks to\r\n  @linzhp.\r\n\r\n## Go changes\r\n\r\n* `go_repository` now works with Go 1.12.\r\n* The `update-repos` command now lets you set attributes such as build file\r\n  names and proto modes on the command line. Thanks to @blico!\r\n* Alternative compilers can now be set on `go_proto_library` rules with the\r\n  `-go_proto_compiler` and `-go_grpc_compiler` flags. Thanks to @bartle-stripe!\r\n* Go repositories may now be imported from Godep. Thanks to @GauntletWizard!\r\n* Imports that can't be resolved using the index when the index is enabled\r\n  are now resolved as external, even if they're under the current prefix.\r\n  This is necessary to handle cases where one repository path is a prefix\r\n  of another. Thanks to @linzhp!\r\n\r\n## Proto changes\r\n\r\n* The new `proto_library` attributes `import_prefix` and `strip_import_prefix`\r\n  may be set with the `# gazelle:proto_import_prefix` and\r\n  `# gazelle:proto_strip_import_prefix` directives or the `-proto_import_prefix`\r\n  command line argument. Thanks to @blico!\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/14644301","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/14644301/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/14644301/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/tag/0.16.0","id":14644301,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTE0NjQ0MzAx","tag_name":"0.16.0","target_commitish":"release-0.16","name":"0.16.0","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2018-12-20T16:33:13Z","published_at":"2019-01-10T00:31:56Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/10247696","id":10247696,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDEwMjQ3Njk2","name":"bazel-gazelle-0.16.0.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1270533,"download_count":863915,"created_at":"2018-12-20T17:45:25Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T17:45:25Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/0.16.0/bazel-gazelle-0.16.0.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/10247697","id":10247697,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDEwMjQ3Njk3","name":"bazel-gazelle-0.16.0.tar.gz.sha256","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":94,"download_count":93,"created_at":"2018-12-20T17:45:25Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T17:45:25Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/0.16.0/bazel-gazelle-0.16.0.tar.gz.sha256"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/tarball/0.16.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/zipball/0.16.0","body":"## Changes\r\n\r\n* [`gazelle_binary`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/blob/master/extend.rst#gazelle_binary) is a new rule that allows developers to support new languages. To support a new language, you may:\r\n  * Create a `go_library` that defines a function named `NewLanguage` that returns a value assignable to [`language.Language`](https://godoc.org/github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/language#Language).\r\n  * Create a `gazelle_binary` target that depends on your `go_library` and other language extensions through the `languages` attribute.\r\n  * Reference your `gazelle_binary` target through the `gazelle` attribute of the [`gazelle`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/blob/master/README.rst#bazel-rule) rule.\r\n  * See [Extending Gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/blob/master/extend.rst) for more information.\r\n* Most Go packages in this repository are now public. You can now use [`rule`](https://godoc.org/github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/rule) and other libraries to write your own tools that manipulate build files.\r\n* Gazelle's `git_repository` and `http_archive` rules are deprecated. You should migrate to Bazel's [`git_repository`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/build_defs/repo/git.bzl) and [`http_archive`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/build_defs/repo/http.bzl) instead.\r\n* Gazelle will visit directories whose names start with `_`. Previously these were considered hidden, but `go build` allows directories with these names to be imported (even if they don't match wildcards). In the next release, directories whose names start with `.` will also be visited.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/13459743","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/13459743/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/13459743/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/tag/0.15.0","id":13459743,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEzNDU5NzQz","tag_name":"0.15.0","target_commitish":"release-0.15","name":"0.15.0","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2018-10-12T22:06:11Z","published_at":"2018-10-16T21:24:48Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/9179794","id":9179794,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDkxNzk3OTQ=","name":"bazel-gazelle-0.15.0.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":1261599,"download_count":222487,"created_at":"2018-10-16T18:41:38Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T18:41:39Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/0.15.0/bazel-gazelle-0.15.0.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/9179795","id":9179795,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDkxNzk3OTU=","name":"bazel-gazelle-0.15.0.tar.gz.sha256","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":94,"download_count":112,"created_at":"2018-10-16T18:41:38Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T18:41:39Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/0.15.0/bazel-gazelle-0.15.0.tar.gz.sha256"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/tarball/0.15.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/zipball/0.15.0","body":"## Changes\r\n\r\n* Gazelle can now import dependencies from go.mod files into WORKSPACE with `gazelle update-repos -from_file=go.mod`. This includes transitive dependencies not explicitly mentioned in go.mod.\r\n* cmd/autogazelle - an experimental new tool for running Gazelle *as part of* each Bazel command. See the [README](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/blob/master/cmd/autogazelle/README.rst) for details.\r\n* New directives:\r\n  * `# gazelle:follow symlink` - follow a specific symlink to a directory. Gazelle normally ignores symbolic links to directories within a repository to avoid visiting a directory on more than one path. When using this, take care to `# gazelle:exclude` the directory from its actual parent to prevent this from happening.\r\n  * `# gazelle:resolve source-lang import-lang import-string label` - specifies an explicit mapping from an import string to a label for dependency resolution.\r\n* New command-line options:\r\n  * `-r=true` - controls whether Gazelle updates build files recursively in directories mentioned on the command line. True by default.\r\n  * `-index=true` - controls whether Gazelle indexes library rules in the repository and uses the index to resolve imports to Bazel labels. True by default.\r\n* The `go_repository` rule now accepts patches and commands in the same format as `git_repository` and `http_archive` from `@bazel_tools`. Patches are applied *after* Gazelle is run (if it is run).\r\n* The `fix` and `update` commands can write patch files with `-mode=patch`.\r\n* The `gazelle` rule can now append to the command line argument list (instead of replacing it) if the arguments are prefixed with `-args`.

All language-specific logic has moved into extensions that implement the internal/languages.Language interface. go and proto are now supported through separate extensions. This will enable Gazelle to support more languages in the future.\r\n  * If you're interested in extending Gazelle, please file an issue or get in touch with me directly.\r\n* Added special cases for proto dependency resolution, both for Go and proto imports. Imports of Google APIs will now resolve to the new `@go_googleapis` repository.\r\n  * There were already special cases for Well Known Types. That logic is modified and extended.\r\n* Added two new proto modes. These can be set with the `-proto=mode` flag on the command line or the `# gazelle:proto mode` directive in build files or with `build_file_proto_mode = \"mode\"` in `go_repository`.\r\n  * `disable_global` - Like `disable` mode, Gazelle won't generate, update, or delete existing `proto_library` or `go_proto_library` rules. In addition, special cases for proto dependency resolution (for Well Known Types and Google APIs) are disabled. This is useful if you build libraries using pre-generated .pb.go files and don't want any build-time dependency on protoc.\r\n  * `package` - Gazelle may generate `proto_library` and `go_proto_library` rules for multiple packages in the same directory. .proto files are grouped into packages using either the declared proto package or an option specified by `# gazelle:proto_group opt`, e.g., `go_package`.\r\n* The `git_repository` and `http_archive` no longer rely on a `cp` executable to copy files. This improves Windows compatibility (thanks @pmuetschard).\r\n* Several more fixes related to paths for Windows compatibility (thanks @pmuetschard).\r\n* `race` and `msan` tags are now ignored. Sources files will be included in rules whether these flags are true or false.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/10906526","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/10906526/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/10906526/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/tag/0.12.0","id":10906526,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEwOTA2NTI2","tag_name":"0.12.0","target_commitish":"release-0.12","name":"0.12.0","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2018-05-08T17:49:03Z","published_at":"2018-05-08T19:42:43Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/7106936","id":7106936,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDcxMDY5MzY=","name":"bazel-gazelle-0.12.0.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":237554,"download_count":97913,"created_at":"2018-05-08T18:51:20Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T18:51:20Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/0.12.0/bazel-gazelle-0.12.0.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/assets/7106937","id":7106937,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDcxMDY5Mzc=","name":"bazel-gazelle-0.12.0.tar.gz.sha256","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":94,"download_count":58,"created_at":"2018-05-08T18:51:20Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T18:51:20Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/releases/download/0.12.0/bazel-gazelle-0.12.0.tar.gz.sha256"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/tarball/0.12.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/zipball/0.12.0","body":"## Changes\r\n\r\n* `importmap` is now a mergeable attribute.
