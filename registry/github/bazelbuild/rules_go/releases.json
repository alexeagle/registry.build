Together with Gazelle v0.32.0, it means that all Go code importing generated code from Google APIs will depend on `@org_golang_google_genproto`, which is resolved by Go modules. For proto files importing Google APIs proto and generating Go code, users need to:\r\n\r\n1. Add an `http_archive` rule to download Google APIs, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"googleapis\",\r\n    sha256 = \"9d1a930e767c93c825398b8f8692eca3fe353b9aaadedfbcf1fca2282c85df88\",\r\n    strip_prefix = \"googleapis-64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/archive/64926d52febbf298cb82a8f472ade4a3969ba922.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@googleapis//:repository_rules.bzl\", \"switched_rules_by_language\")\r\n\r\nswitched_rules_by_language(\r\n    name = \"com_google_googleapis_imports\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the version of Google APIs archive needs to be compatible with the pre-generated code in `@org_golang_google_genproto`.\r\n\r\n2. Resolve the proto manually. If Gazelle is being used, directives like the following need to be added to a parent directory of the proto files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto proto google/rpc/status.proto @googleapis//google/rpc:status_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/rpc/status.proto  @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/rpc/status\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto google/longrunning/operations.proto @googleapis//google/longrunning:operations_proto\r\n# gazelle:resolve proto go google/longrunning/operations.proto @org_golang_google_genproto//googleapis/longrunning\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther changes included in this release\r\n\r\n* detect_sdk_version: Support 1.21's new VERSION file format by @evanj in

Changes\r\n\r\n* Experimental editor / IDE integration added in the form of a\r\n  gopackagesdriver tool that reports information about the Bazel workspace\r\n  to gopls (or any other tool based on `golang.org/x/tools/go/packages`).\r\n  See the [Editor setup](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/wiki/Editor-setup)\r\n  on the wiki for information and setup instructions. Huge thanks to @steeve\r\n  for shipping this.\r\n* Target platform may be automatically inferred from `--crosstool_top` and\r\n  `--cpu` for iOS and Android platforms that still require these flags.\r\n  Again, thanks to @steeve.\r\n* `go_proto_library` no longer implicitly depends on APIv1 Well Known Type\r\n  packages. Since protoc 3.14, the Well Known Types declare APIv2 package paths,\r\n  which means generated code that imports them will import APIv2 packages,\r\n  so the APIv1 dependencies are unnecessary.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* Bazel 4.0.0 (LTS) or higher is now required. The previous minimum version\r\n  was 3.5.0.\r\n\r\n## Updated dependencies\r\n\r\nAs always, you can use higher versions of rules\\_go's dependencies by declaring\r\nthem in WORKSPACE before calling `go_rules_dependencies`. Lower versions may\r\nwork but are not supported.\r\n\r\n* `org_golang_x_tools` updated to `v0.1.4`\r\n* `org_golang_x_sys` updated to `master` as of 2021-06-30.\r\n* `rules_cc` updated to `main` as of 2021-06-30.\r\n* `org_golang_google_protobuf` updated to `v1.27.1`.\r\n* `org_github_golang_protobuf` updated to `v1.5.2`.\r\n* `org_golang_google_genproto` updated to `master` as of 2021-06-30.\r\n* `go_googleapis` updated to `master` as of 2021-06-30.\r\n\r\n## `WORKSPACE` code\r\n\r\n```\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\nhttp_archive(\r\n    name = \"io_bazel_rules_go\",\r\n    sha256 = \"8e968b5fcea1d2d64071872b12737bbb5514524ee5f0a4f54f5920266c261acb\",\r\n    urls = [\r\n        \"https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.28.0/rules_go-v0.28.0.zip\",\r\n        \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.28.0/rules_go-v0.28.0.zip\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\nload(\"@io_bazel_rules_go//go:deps.bzl\", \"go_register_toolchains\", \"go_rules_dependencies\")\r\n\r\ngo_rules_dependencies()\r\n\r\ngo_register_toolchains(version = \"1.16.5\")\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/45801768/reactions","total_count":29,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":17,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":12,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/40010077","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/40010077/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/40010077/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/tag/v0.27.0","id":40010077,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQwMDEwMDc3","tag_name":"v0.27.0","target_commitish":"release-0.27","name":"v0.27.0","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2021-03-17T18:52:49Z","published_at":"2021-03-18T15:02:42Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/assets/33648853","id":33648853,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDMzNjQ4ODUz","name":"rules_go-v0.27.0.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":633704,"download_count":283136,"created_at":"2021-03-18T14:47:37Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T14:47:38Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.27.0/rules_go-v0.27.0.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/tarball/v0.27.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/zipball/v0.27.0","body":"## Updated dependencies\r\n\r\nThis release updates `golang.org/x/tools`, which was mistakenly not updated in v0.26.0.

Changes\r\n\r\n* `//go:embed` directives are supported in Go 1.16. Patterns are matched against both static and generated files, including directory artifacts. Embeddable files must be listed in the new `embedsrcs` attribute. Gazelle v0.23.0 will generate these attributes automatically.\r\n* `go_binary` now provides `CcInfo` in the `c-archive` and `c-shared` link modes. This should let `cc_library` and other rules reference these targets through `deps` directly. Thanks @steeve.\r\n* `TEST_TMPDIR` is no longer set to `TMPDIR` in tests.

Changes\r\n\r\n* `go_download_sdk` and `go_register_toolchains` can now download any version of Go from `golang.org/dl` without the need for hardcoded support in rules_go.\r\n  * Consequently, the `version` parameter *must* be set to a string like `\"1.15.5\"` or to `\"host\"`. This requires a change to `WORKSPACE` for most users. See [`go_register_toolchains`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/go/toolchains.rst#go-register-toolchains) for details.\r\n  * `go_download_sdk` queries `https://golang.org/dl` in order to find SHA-256 of toolchains. Bazel won't cache downloaded files without these. If your build has limited network access, use `version = \"host\"` or set the `sdks` and `urls` attributes in [`go_download_sdk`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/blob/master/go/toolchains.rst#id15).\r\n  * As a result of this change, rules_go will no longer need patch releases for new Go versions. The v0.24 branch will still be patched as long as it's supported.\r\n* Package conflicts are now errors rather than warnings. The linker already reports errors for most of these since Go 1.15.\r\n* rules_go now uses Bazel's modern C/C++ Starlark linker API.\r\n* `go_path` supports the `include_transitive` attribute, which controls whether transitively imported packages are included (thanks @steeve)\r\n* `go_test` changes to the test directory in an `init` function run before other package `init`s instead of in `main` (thanks @dragonsinth)\r\n* Several deprecated features were removed. See [Deprecation schedule](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/wiki/Deprecation-schedule) for information on removals.\r\n  * `go_rule` wrapper.\r\n  * `go_archive_aspect` and `GoAspectProvider`.\r\n  * It is now an error when a `go_binary` or `go_test` depends on another `go_binary` or `go_test`.\r\n  * `--feature` flags are no longer used for configuration. Use flags like `--@io_bazel_rules_go//go/config:pure` instead.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* Go 1.13 is no longer supported.\r\n* Bazel 3.4.0 is now required.\r\n* This release is expected to be compatible with Bazel 4.0.0. Earlier rules_go releases may not work due to incompatible changes in the C/C++ APIs.\r\n\r\n## Updated dependencies\r\n\r\nAs always you can use higher versions of rules_go's dependencies by declaring them in `WORKSPACE` before calling `go_rules_dependencies`. Lower versions may work but are not supported.\r\n\r\n* `platforms` is updated to `0.0.1`.\r\n* `rules_cc` is updated to `master` as of 2020-12-01.\r\n* `bazel_skylib` is updated to `1.0.3`.\r\n* `org_golang_x_tools` is updated to `master` as of 2020-12-01.\r\n* `com_github_golang_protobuf` is updated to `v1.4.3`.\r\n* `org_golang_google_genproto` is updated to `master` as of 2020-12-01.\r\n* `go_googleapis` is updated to `master` as of 2020-12-01.\r\n\r\n## `WORKSPACE` code\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The code below has changed. In `go_register_toolchains`, `version` must be set to a string like `\"1.15.5\"` or to `\"host\"` unless a Go toolchain is declared earlier.\r\n\r\n    load(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\r\n\r\n    http_archive(\r\n        name = \"io_bazel_rules_go\",\r\n        sha256 = \"6f111c57fd50baf5b8ee9d63024874dd2a014b069426156c55adbf6d3d22cb7b\",\r\n        urls = [\r\n            \"https://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.25.0/rules_go-v0.25.0.tar.gz\",\r\n            \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.25.0/rules_go-v0.25.0.tar.gz\",\r\n        ],\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    load(\"@io_bazel_rules_go//go:deps.bzl\", \"go_register_toolchains\", \"go_rules_dependencies\")\r\n\r\n    go_rules_dependencies()\r\n\r\n    go_register_toolchains(version = \"1.15.5\")\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/34710167","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/34710167/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/34710167/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/tag/v0.24.8","id":34710167,"author":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM0NzEwMTY3","tag_name":"v0.24.8","target_commitish":"release-0.24","name":"v0.24.8","draft":false,"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2020-12-02T18:45:39Z","published_at":"2020-12-02T19:57:36Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/assets/29051748","id":29051748,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDI5MDUxNzQ4","name":"rules_go-v0.24.8.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"jayconrod","id":164791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod","html_url":"https://github.com/jayconrod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayconrod/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-gzip","state":"uploaded","size":518710,"download_count":31,"created_at":"2020-12-02T18:54:35Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T18:54:36Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/download/v0.24.8/rules_go-v0.24.8.tar.gz"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/tarball/v0.24.8","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bazelbuild/rules_go/zipball/v0.24.8","body":"## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* `go_test` no longer requires `TestMain` to call `os.Exit` (thanks @rabbbit)\r\n* `@io_bazel_rules_go//proto/wkt:field_mask_go_proto`,\r\n  `source_context_go_proto`, and `type_go_proto` are now wrappers around the\r\n  pre-generated sources in `google.golang.org/protobuf`.
