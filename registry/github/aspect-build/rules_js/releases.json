Discussion](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/discussions/1000).\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> 🏎️ This release adds a performance improvement for parsing the pnpm lock file in the `npm_translate_lock` repository rule by using [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) from [aspect_bazel_lib](https://docs.aspect.build/rulesets/aspect_bazel_lib/#transforming-files). yq is approx 7X faster than the custom Starlark yaml parser used prior to this release. Thanks to @dzbarsky for teeing this one up in https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/pull/1378 🧙.\r\n>\r\n> Benchmarks on two different size lock files:\r\n> - 100k line lock file: starlark yaml parser 3.5s, yq 470ms\r\n> - 27k line lock file: starlark yaml parser 1.6s, yq 240ms\r\n>\r\n> If you have issues with `yq` yaml parsing, you can switch to the legacy starlark yaml parser by setting `use_starlark_yaml_parser = True` on your `npm_translate_lock`. In exceptional cases, it is possible that pnpm will generate a yaml file that `yq` fails to parse.
