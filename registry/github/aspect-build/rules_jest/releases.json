BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️\r\n\r\n`jest_repositories` repository rule is removed and a new `node_modules` attribute is now required for `jest_test`. This change is BREAKING for all users.\r\n\r\nThe `//path/to:node_modules` tree target must be passed to the `jest_test` rules via the `node_modules` attribute. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\njest_test(\r\n    name = \"test\",\r\n    node_modules = \"//:node_modules\",\r\n    ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need `jest-cli` and `jest-junit` linked in the node_modules tree provided. The `jest-junit` requirement can be removed by setting `auto_configure_reporters = False` on your `jest_test` targets.\r\n\r\nThis change has the added benefits of not requiring users to keep the jest version used in their `package.json` in sync with their WORKSPACE and not requiring any changes to `rules_jest` to support new releases of jest.\r\n\r\nThis change is in the spirit of the change in rules_webpack [v0.11.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_webpack/releases/tag/v0.11.0), rules_jasmine [v0.4.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_jasmine/releases/tag/v0.4.0), rules_rollup [v0.14.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_rollup/releases/tag/v0.14.0) and rules_terser [v0.14.0](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_terser/releases/tag/v0.14.0) so the patterns on the downstream rules_js rulesets we maintain are aligned both for maintainers and for users.\r\n\r\n## WORKSPACE snippet\r\n\r\n```starlark\r\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\",
