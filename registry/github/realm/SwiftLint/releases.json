Breaking\n\n* None.\n\n#### Experimental\n\n* None.\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n* Make severity for unallowed symbols configurable. The option name is\n  `unallowed_symbols_severity`. It accepts the two values `warning` and `error`\n  (default) as usual.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Mention a rule's identifier in the console message that is printed when the\n  rule's associated configuration entry contains invalid values.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n\n* Silence `xct_specific_matcher` rule on \"one argument asserts\" if there are\n  potential types or tuples involved in the comparison as types and tuples do\n  not conform to `Equatable`.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#4990](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4990)\n\n* Add `grouping` option to the `sorted_imports` rule allowing\n  to sort groups of imports defined by their preceding attributes\n  (e.g. `@testable`, `@_exported`, ...).  \n  [hiltonc](https://github.com/hiltonc)\n\n* Add new `--silence-deprecation-warnings` flag that silences deprecation\n  warnings that would otherwise be printed to the console.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#4989](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4989)\n\n* Do not trigger `redundant_self_in_closure` rule when another idenfier `x` in\n  scope shadows the field accessed by `self.x` to avoid semantical changes.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5010](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5010)\n\n* Rewrite `todo` rule with SwiftSyntax.  \n  [woxtu](https://github.com/woxtu)\n\n* Adds an `unneeded_synthesized_initializer` rule, based on\n  `swift-format`'s `UseSynthesizedInitializer` rule, which warns\n  when a defined default or memberwise initializer would have been\n  automatically synthesized.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* The option `validates_start_with_lowercase` can now be disabled by setting it\n  to `off`.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5036](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5036)\n\n* Do not trigger `prefer_self_in_static_references` rule on `typealias`\n  declarations in classes.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5009](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5009)\n\n* Do not trigger `prefer_self_in_static_references` rule on collection types in\n  classes, but on initializers like `[C]()` in all types.  \n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\n  [#5042](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/5042)\n\n* Fix false positives on `redundant_objc_attribute` rule for enums\n  and private members.  \n  [Martin Redington](https://github.com/mildm8nnered)\n  [#4633](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4633)\n\n* Fix autocorrect for `CGIntersectionRect` in `legacy_cggeometry_functions`\n  rule.  \n  [Haoocen](https://github.com/Haoocen)\n  [#5023](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/pull/5023)\n\n* Fix false positives on `sorted_first_last` rule when `first`/`last` have\n  a predicate.  \n  [woxtu](https://github.com/woxtu)\n  [#3023](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3023)\n\n* Work around dyld warning about duplicate SwiftSyntax classes with Xcode 15\n  betas.  \n  [keith](https://github.com/keith)\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\n  [#4782](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4782)\n\n---\n\n### Using Bazel\n\nWith

The default branch for the SwiftLint git repository will be renamed from\r\n`master` to `main` on September 1st. Please update any code or automation\r\naccordingly._\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n* SwiftLint now requires Swift 5.6 or higher to build, and macOS 12\r\n  or higher to run.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Code Climate reports now use SHA256 strings as the issue fingerprint\r\n  values.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma_inheritance` an opt-in rule.  \r\n  [Steve Madsen](https://github.com/sjmadsen)\r\n  [#4027](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4027)\r\n\r\n* The `autocorrect` command that was deprecated in 0.43.0 has now been\r\n  completely removed. Use `--fix` instead.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Remove the `AutomaticTestableRule` protocol. All examples listed in rules are\r\n  now tested automatically to make sure they are correct.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Deprecate the `--in-process-sourcekit` command line flag. SwiftLint now always\r\n  uses an in-process SourceKit.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Make `duplicate_imports` rule correctable. Fix `duplicate_imports` rule\r\n  reporting redundant violations when more than one duplicate is present.  \r\n  [Timofey Solonin](https://github.com/abdulowork)\r\n\r\n* Support for building SwiftLint with bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Support for writing custom private native rules when building with\r\n  bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [Keith Smiley](https://github.com/keith)\r\n  [#3516](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3516)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma` rule about 10x faster, finding some previously missed cases and\r\n  fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `colon` rule about 7x faster, finding some previously missed cases.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `closure_spacing` rule about 9x faster, finding some previously missed\r\n  cases and fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4090](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4090)\r\n\r\n* Introduce new configuration option `include_compiler_directives` (`true` by\r\n  default) for the `indentation_width` rule that allows to ignore compiler\r\n  directives in the indentation analysis. This is especially useful if one (or\r\n  a formatter) prefers to have compiler directives always at the very beginning\r\n  of a line.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4030](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4030)\r\n\r\n* Enable (recursive) globs in `included` file paths.  \r\n  [sarastro-nl](https://github.com/sarastro-nl)\r\n\r\n* Custom rules are now broken down per rule instead of in aggregate in\r\n  `--benchmark`.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* The `version` command now has an optional `--verbose` flag that prints out the\r\n  full version info, notably the build ID, which can be used to determine if two\r\n  `swiftlint` executables are identical.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Update documentation for `multiline_arguments_brackets` and\r\n  `multiline_literal_brackets` to make it immediately obvious that common\r\n  examples will trigger.  \r\n  [chrisjf](https://github.com/chrisjf)\r\n  [#4060](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4060)\r\n\r\n* The `--compile-commands` argument can now parse SwiftPM yaml files produced\r\n  when running `swift build` at `.build/{debug,release}.yaml`.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Add new configuration option `allowed_no_space_operators` to\r\n  `operator_usage_whitespace` rule. It allows to specify custom operators which\r\n  shall not be considered by the rule.  \r\n  [imben123](https://github.com/imben123)\r\n\r\n* Add new protocols to remove some boilerplate involved in writing\r\n  SwiftSyntax-based rules.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `self_in_property_initialization` rule when using\r\n  closures inside `didSet` and other accessors.  \r\n  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)\r\n  [#4041](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4041)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `Duplicated Key in Dictionary Literal Violation` rule\r\n  when using keys that are generated at runtime with the same source code.  \r\n  [OrEliyahu](https://github.com/OrEliyahu)\r\n  [#4012](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4012)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `yoda_condition` rule by basing it on SwiftSyntax.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4081](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4081)\r\n\r\n* Fix false negatives in `first_where` rule when filtering array of dictionaries\r\n  with String keys.  \r\n  [KS1019](https://github.com/KS1019)\r\n\r\n* Fix broken correction for `explicit_init` rule.  \r\n  [KS1019](https://github.com/KS1019)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Using Bazel\r\n\r\nPut this in your

Please update any code or automation\r\naccordingly._\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n* SwiftLint now requires Swift 5.6 or higher to build, and macOS 12\r\n  or higher to run.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Code Climate reports now use SHA256 strings as the issue fingerprint\r\n  values.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma_inheritance` an opt-in rule.  \r\n  [Steve Madsen](https://github.com/sjmadsen)\r\n  [#4027](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4027)\r\n\r\n* The `autocorrect` command that was deprecated in 0.43.0 has now been\r\n  completely removed. Use `--fix` instead.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Remove the `AutomaticTestableRule` protocol. All examples listed in rules are\r\n  now tested automatically to make sure they are correct.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Deprecate the `--in-process-sourcekit` command line flag. SwiftLint now always\r\n  uses an in-process SourceKit.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Make `duplicate_imports` rule correctable. Fix `duplicate_imports` rule\r\n  reporting redundant violations when more than one duplicate is present.  \r\n  [Timofey Solonin](https://github.com/abdulowork)\r\n\r\n* Support for building SwiftLint with bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Support for writing custom private native rules when building with\r\n  bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [Keith Smiley](https://github.com/keith)\r\n  [#3516](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3516)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma` rule about 10x faster, finding some previously missed cases and\r\n  fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `colon` rule about 7x faster, finding some previously missed cases.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `closure_spacing` rule about 9x faster, finding some previously missed\r\n  cases and fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4090](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4090)\r\n\r\n* Introduce new configuration option `include_compiler_directives` (`true` by\r\n  default) for the `indentation_width` rule that allows to ignore compiler\r\n  directives in the indentation analysis. This is especially useful if one (or\r\n  a formatter) prefers to have compiler directives always at the very beginning\r\n  of a line.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4030](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4030)\r\n\r\n* Enable (recursive) globs in `included` file paths.  \r\n  [sarastro-nl](https://github.com/sarastro-nl)\r\n\r\n* Custom rules are now broken down per rule instead of in aggregate in\r\n  `--benchmark`.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* The `version` command now has an optional `--verbose` flag that prints out the\r\n  full version info, notably the build ID, which can be used to determine if two\r\n  `swiftlint` executables are identical.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Update documentation for `multiline_arguments_brackets` and\r\n  `multiline_literal_brackets` to make it immediately obvious that common\r\n  examples will trigger.  \r\n  [chrisjf](https://github.com/chrisjf)\r\n  [#4060](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4060)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `self_in_property_initialization` rule when using\r\n  closures inside `didSet` and other accessors.  \r\n  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)\r\n  [#4041](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4041)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `Duplicated Key in Dictionary Literal Violation` rule\r\n  when using keys that are generated at runtime with the same source code.  \r\n  [OrEliyahu](https://github.com/OrEliyahu)\r\n  [#4012](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4012)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `yoda_condition` rule by basing it on SwiftSyntax.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4081](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4081)\r\n\r\n* Fix false negatives in `first_where` rule when filtering array of dictionaries\r\n  with String keys.  \r\n  [KS1019](https://github.com/KS1019)\r\n\r\n* Fix broken correction for `explicit_init` rule.  \r\n  [KS1019](https://github.com/KS1019)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Using Bazel\r\n\r\nPut this in your

is a prerelease version. It won't be published to Homebrew or CocoaPods. But there are many other ways to install:\r\n\r\n* Downloading the attached `SwiftLint.pkg` installer and launching it\r\n* Downloading the attached `portable_swiftlint.zip` archive, extracting it and moving the binary from `portable_swiftlint/swiftlint` to `/usr/local/bin` or elsewhere in your `PATH`\r\n* Using [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint): `mint install realm/SwiftLint@0.49.0-rc.1`\r\n* Cloning and building from source: `git clone https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint.git && cd SwiftLint && git checkout 0.49.0-rc.1 && make install`\r\n* Docker: ```docker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` ghcr.io/realm/swiftlint:0.49.0-rc.1```\r\n* Bazel: See instructions at the bottom\r\n\r\nChanges from 0.48.0: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/compare/0.48.0...0.49.0-rc.1\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Note: The default branch for the SwiftLint git repository will be renamed from\r\n`master` to `main` on September 1st. Please update any code or automation\r\naccordingly._\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n* SwiftLint now requires Swift 5.6 or higher to build, and macOS 12\r\n  or higher to run.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Code Climate reports now use SHA256 strings as the issue fingerprint\r\n  values.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma_inheritance` an opt-in rule.  \r\n  [Steve Madsen](https://github.com/sjmadsen)\r\n  [#4027](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4027)\r\n\r\n* The `autocorrect` command that was deprecated in 0.43.0 has now been\r\n  completely removed. Use `--fix` instead.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Remove the `AutomaticTestableRule` protocol. All examples listed in rules are\r\n  now tested automatically to make sure they are correct.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n\r\n* Deprecate the `--in-process-sourcekit` command line flag. SwiftLint now always\r\n  uses an in-process SourceKit.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* None.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\n  \r\n* Make `duplicate_imports` rule correctable. Fix `duplicate_imports` rule \r\n  reporting redundant violations when more than one duplicate is present.  \r\n  [Timofey Solonin](https://github.com/abdulowork)\r\n\r\n* Support for building SwiftLint with bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Support for writing custom private native rules when building with\r\n  bazel.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n  [Keith Smiley](https://github.com/keith)\r\n  [#3516](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/3516)\r\n\r\n* Make `comma` rule about 10x faster, finding some previously missed cases and\r\n  fixing some previously wrong corrections.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Make `colon` rule about 7x faster, finding some previously missed cases.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* Introduce new configuration option `include_compiler_directives` (`true` by\r\n  default) for the `indentation_width` rule that allows to ignore compiler\r\n  directives in the indentation analysis. This is especially useful if one (or\r\n  a formatter) prefers to have compiler directives always at the very beginning\r\n  of a line.  \r\n  [SimplyDanny](https://github.com/SimplyDanny)\r\n  [#4030](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4030)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `self_in_property_initialization` rule when using\r\n  closures inside `didSet` and other accessors.  \r\n  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)\r\n  [#4041](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/4041)\r\n\r\n* Fix false positive in `Duplicated Key in Dictionary Literal Violation` rule\r\n  when using keys that are generated at runtime with the same source code.  \r\n  [OrEliyahu](https://github.com/OrEliyahu)\r\n

is a prerelease version. It won't be published to Homebrew or CocoaPods. But there are many other ways to install:\r\n\r\n* Downloading the attached `SwiftLint.pkg` installer and launching it\r\n* Downloading the attached `portable_swiftlint.zip` archive, extracting it and moving the binary from `portable_swiftlint/swiftlint` to `/usr/local/bin` or elsewhere in your `PATH`\r\n* Using [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint): `mint install realm/SwiftLint@0.47.0-rc.1`\r\n* Cloning and building from source: `git clone https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint.git && cd SwiftLint && git checkout 0.47.0-rc.1 && make install`\r\n* Docker: ```docker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` ghcr.io/realm/swiftlint:0.47.0-rc.1```\r\n\r\nChanges from 0.46.5: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/compare/0.46.5...0.47.0-rc.1\r\n\r\n#### Breaking\r\n\r\n* SwiftLint now requires Swift 5.5 or higher to build.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n* The `SwiftLintFramework` podspec has been removed. To our knowledge, this was\r\n  completely unused by other projects and was not worth the complexity needed\r\n  to justify its continued maintenance, especially in light of the integration\r\n  of SwiftSyntax. The `SwiftLint` podspec is still supported.  \r\n  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n* The `force_cast` rule and the comment command parsing mechanism have been\r\n  updated to use SwiftSyntax instead of SourceKit. Please report any problems\r\n  you encounter by opening a GitHub issue. If this is successful, more rules may\r\n  use Swift Syntax in the future.  \r\n  [JP
