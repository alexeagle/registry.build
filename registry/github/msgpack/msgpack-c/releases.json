<< recommended changes >>\n- Define [MSGPACK_DISABLE_LEGACY_NIL](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/wiki/v1_1_cpp_configure#msgpack_disable_legacy_nil-since-140), then `msgpack::type::nil` is replaced by with `msgpack::type::nil_t` (#408, #411, #412).\n  Replace `msgpack::type::nil` with `msgpack::type::nil_t` in client codes.\n  `msgpack::type::nil` will be removed on the version 2.0.0.\n- Define [MSGPACK_DISABLE_LEGACY_CONVERT](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/wiki/v1_1_cpp_configure#msgpack_disable_legacy_convert-since-140), then `msgpack::object::convert(T*)` is removed (#410).\n  Replace calling `msgpack::bojectconvert(T*)` with `msgpack::bojectconvert(T&)` in client codes as follows:\n  \n  ``` C++\n   int i;\n   obj.convert(&i); // before\n  ```\n  \n  ``` C++\n   int i;\n   obj.convert(i);  // after\n  ```\n  \n  `msgpack::object::convert(T*)` will be removed on the version 2.0.0.\n\nDefine the macros above as follows when you compile C++ codes that use msgpack-c:\n\n```\ng++ -Ipath_to_msgpack/include -DMSGPACK_DISABLE_LEGACY_NIL -DMSGPACK_DISABLE_LEGACY_CONVERT your_code.cpp\n\n```\n\nYou can compile existing codes without defining macros above but I recommend defining them and updating your codes to fix the issues #408, #411, #412, #399, and #410. It is also a good preparation for the version 2.0.0.\n\n## << other updates >>\n- Improve documents (#387, #407)\n- Remove C++ version library (#394, #402)\n- Add Doxyfile and ChangeLog to the distribution package (#397)\n- Add signed/unsigned char test to travis-ci (#398)\n- Remove some warnings (#400, #401, #409)\n- Fix endian checking.
