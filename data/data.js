However, \u003ccode\u003epex\u003c/code\u003e is very slow when packaging targets that have large third-party dependencies, since it unzips and rezips everything. These rules started as an exploration to understand why Pex is so slow, and eventually morphed into the rules as they are today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"implementation-overview\"\u003eImplementation overview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Python \u0026quot;executable\u0026quot; is a directory tree of Python files, with an \u0026quot;entry point\u0026quot; module that is invoked as \u003ccode\u003e__main__\u003c/code\u003e. We want to be able to define executables with different sets of dependencies that possibly conflict (e.g. executable \u003ccode\u003efoo\u003c/code\u003e may want \u003ccode\u003eexample_module\u003c/code\u003e to be imported, but executable \u003ccode\u003ebar\u003c/code\u003e may need \u003ccode\u003eexample_module\u003c/code\u003e to not exist, or be a different version). To do this, we build a directory tree containing all dependencies, and generate a \u003ccode\u003e__main__.py\u003c/code\u003e. This makes the directory executable by either running \u003ccode\u003epython executable_exedir\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003epython executable_exedir/__main__.py\u003c/code\u003e. To make this more convenient, we also generate a shell script to invoke python with the correct arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if we have an executable named \u003ccode\u003eexecutable\u003c/code\u003e, which runs a script called \u003ccode\u003eexecutable.py\u003c/code\u003e that depends on \u003ccode\u003esomepackage.module\u003c/code\u003e, it will generate the following files:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eexecutable          (generated shell script: runs executable_exedir)\nexecutable_exedir\n├── executable.py\n├── __main__.py     (generated main script: runs executable.py)\n└── somepackage\n    ├── __init__.py\n    └── module.py\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eexecutable_exedir\u003c/code\u003e can be zipped into a zip file with a \u003ccode\u003e#!\u003c/code\u003e interpreter line, so it can be directly executed. This may introduce incompatibilities: many Python programs depend on reading resource files relative to their source files which fails when loaded from a zip. By default for maximum compatibility, the \u003ccode\u003e__main__.py\u003c/code\u003e will unzip everything into a temporary directory, execute that, then delete it at execute. You can set \u003ccode\u003ezip_safe=True\u003c/code\u003e on the \u003ccode\u003epyz_binary\u003c/code\u003e to override this behaviour. At build time, if any native code libraries are detected, the rules write a manifest (\u003ccode\u003e_zip_info_.json\u003c/code\u003e) that instructs \u003ccode\u003e__main__.py\u003c/code\u003e to unpack these files because they cannot be loaded from a zip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"creating-an-isolated-python-environment\"\u003eCreating an \u0026quot;isolated\u0026quot; Python environment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe want executables generated by these rules to be \u0026quot;isolated\u0026quot;: They should only rely on the system Python interpreter and the standard library. Any custom packages or environment variables should be ignored, so running the program always works. It turns out this is tricky: If the default \u003ccode\u003epython\u003c/code\u003e binary is part of a virtual environment for example, in behaves slightly differently than a \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot; Python interpreter. Users may have added \u003ccode\u003e.pth\u003c/code\u003e files to their \u003ccode\u003esite-packages\u003c/code\u003e directory to customize their environment. To resolve this, \u003ccode\u003e__main__.py\u003c/code\u003e tries very hard to establish a \u0026quot;clean\u0026quot; environment, which complicates the startup code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo do it, we execute \u003ccode\u003e__main__.py\u003c/code\u003e with the Python flags \u003ccode\u003e-E -S -s\u003c/code\u003e which ignores \u003ccode\u003ePYTHON*\u003c/code\u003e environment variables, and does not load \u003ccode\u003esite-packages\u003c/code\u003e. Unfortunately, to execute a zip, Python needs the \u003ccode\u003erunpy\u003c/code\u003e module which is in \u003ccode\u003esite-packages\u003c/code\u003e. Additionally, people might explicitly execute \u003ccode\u003epython ..._exedir\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003epython ..._exedir/__main__.py\u003c/code\u003e. In those cases, if we find the \u003ccode\u003esite\u003c/code\u003e module, we re-execute Python with the correct flags, to ensure the program sees a clean environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTODO: pex has code to clean the \u003ccode\u003esys.modules\u003c/code\u003e which we should borrow at some point, since it avoids re-executing Python which decreases startup overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"bazel-implementation-runfiles\"\u003eBazel implementation: Runfiles\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make tests run quickly in Bazel, it is best to not copy files into an \u003ccode\u003e_exedir\u003c/code\u003e.

It has a full featured remote downloader, with a content-address-cached (confusingly called the \u0026quot;repository cache\u0026quot;). We now mirror pnpm's lock file\ninto starlark code, then use only Bazel repository rules to perform fetches and translate the\ndependency graph into Bazel's representation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor historical context, we started thinking about this in February 2021 in a (now outdated) \u003ca href=\"https://hackmd.io/gu2Nj0TKS068LKAf8KanuA\"\u003edesign doc\u003c/a\u003e\nand have been working through the details since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"running-nodejs-programs\"\u003eRunning nodejs programs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFundamentally, Bazel operates out of a different filesystem layout than Node.\nBazel keeps outputs in a distinct tree outside of the sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first attempt was based on what Yarn PnP and Google-internal nodejs rules do:\nmonkey-patch the implementation of \u003ccode\u003erequire\u003c/code\u003e in NodeJS itself,\nso that every resolution can be aware of the source/output tree difference.\nThe main downside to this is compatibility: many packages on npm make their own assumptions about\nhow to resolve dependencies without asking the \u003ccode\u003erequire\u003c/code\u003e implementation, and you can't patch them all.\nUnlike Google, most of us don't want to re-write all the npm packages we use to be compatible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur second attempt was essentially to run \u003ccode\u003enpm link\u003c/code\u003e before running a program, using a runtime linker.\nThis was largely successful at papering over the filesystem layout differences without disrupting\nexecution of programs. However, it required a lot of workarounds anytime a JS tool wanted to be\naware of the input and output locations on disk. For example, many tools like react-scripts (the\nbuild system used by Create React App aka. CRA) insist on writing their outputs relative to the\nworking directory. Such programs were forced to be run with Bazel's output folder as the working\ndirectory, and their sources copied to that location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003erules_js\u003c/code\u003e takes a better approach, where we follow that react-scripts-prompted workaround to the\nextreme. We \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e run JS tools with the working directory in Bazel's output tree.\nWe can use a \u003ccode\u003epnpm\u003c/code\u003e-style layout tool to create a \u003ccode\u003enode_modules\u003c/code\u003e under \u003ccode\u003ebazel-out\u003c/code\u003e, and all resolutions\nnaturally work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis third approach has trade-offs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe benefit is that very intractable problems like TypeScript's \u003ccode\u003erootDirs\u003c/code\u003e just go away.\nIn that example, we filed \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37378\"\u003ehttps://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37378\u003c/a\u003e but it probably\nwon't be solved, so many users trip over issues like\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/3423\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e and\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/3421\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e.

It has still-developing features like a bundler,\nbut you might want to use something else as a bundler, like esbuild.\nBazel's agnostic unix-pipeline-style composition of tools allows you to mix-and-match the best parts of\nthe JS ecosystem, regardless what language they run on.\nWith Bazel, you won't need to figure out SWC's plugin infrastructure.\nYou can have SWC do what it's good at, and not even have it involved with the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNeed help?\u003c/em\u003e This ruleset has support provided by \u003ca href=\"https://aspect.dev\"\u003ehttps://aspect.dev\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"features\"\u003eFeatures\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese rules provide a hermetic toolchain that runs the SWC cli, so it doesn't matter what is\nalready installed on a developer's machine, they're guaranteed to get the same result.\nIt caches all the tools using Bazel's downloader.\nThis means that even when Bazel determines that a repository is invalidated and re-runs the setup\n(due to running \u003ccode\u003ebazel sync --configure\u003c/code\u003e for example, or after a \u003ccode\u003ebazel clean --expunge\u003c/code\u003e)\nnothing is fetched from the network.

This process captures the list of dependencies into a\nzip file.  This zip file is distributed with your Bazel rules. This\nmakes your rule more hermetic, your rule no longer relies on the user\nto supply the correct dependencies, because they get resolved under\ntheir own repository namespace rather than being intermingled with the\nuser's, and your dependencies no longer conflict with the users\nselections.

For example, a \u003ccode\u003egit_repository\u003c/code\u003e rule for \u003ccode\u003eorg_golang_x_tools\u003c/code\u003e |\n| could be overriden with the directive: |\n| |\n| .. code:: bzl |\n| |\n| # gazelle:repository go_repository name=org_golang_x_tools importpath=golang.org/x/tools |\n| |\n| Gazelle would then proceed as if \u003ccode\u003eorg_golang_x_tools\u003c/code\u003e was declared as a \u003ccode\u003ego_repository\u003c/code\u003e rule. |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eKeep comments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to directives, Gazelle supports \u003ccode\u003e# keep\u003c/code\u003e comments that protect\nparts of build files from being modified. \u003ccode\u003e# keep\u003c/code\u003e may be written before\na rule, before an attribute, or after a string within a list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003e# keep\u003c/code\u003e comments might take one of 2 forms; the \u003ccode\u003e# keep\u003c/code\u003e literal or a\ndescription prefixed by # keep: .\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4\u003eExample\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose you have a library that includes a generated .go file.

These rules may be disabled by adding\n \u003ccode\u003e# gazelle:proto disable_global\u003c/code\u003e to a build file (this will affect\n subdirectories, too) or by passing \u003ccode\u003e-proto disable_global\u003c/code\u003e on the\n command line.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ea) Imports of Well Known Types are mapped to rules in\n \u003ccode\u003e@io_bazel_rules_go//proto/wkt\u003c/code\u003e.\n b) Imports of Google APIs are mapped to \u003ccode\u003e@go_googleapis\u003c/code\u003e.\n c) Imports of \u003ccode\u003egithub.com/golang/protobuf/ptypes\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003edescriptor\u003c/code\u003e, and\n \u003ccode\u003ejsonpb\u003c/code\u003e are mapped to special rules in \u003ccode\u003e@com_github_golang_protobuf\u003c/code\u003e.\n See Avoiding conflicts with proto rulesAvoiding conflicts with proto rulesAvoiding conflicts with proto rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf the import to be resolved is in the library index, the import will be resolved\n to that library. If \u003ccode\u003e-index=true\u003c/code\u003e, Gazelle builds an index of library rules in\n the current repository before starting dependency resolution, and this is how\n most dependencies are resolved.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ea) For Go, the match is based on the \u003ccode\u003eimportpath\u003c/code\u003e attribute.\n b) For proto, the match is based on the \u003ccode\u003esrcs\u003c/code\u003e attribute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf \u003ccode\u003e-index=false\u003c/code\u003e and a package is imported that has the current \u003ccode\u003ego_prefix\u003c/code\u003e\n as a prefix, Gazelle generates a label following a convention. For example, if\n the build file in \u003ccode\u003e//src\u003c/code\u003e set the prefix with\n \u003ccode\u003e# gazelle:prefix example.com/repo/foo\u003c/code\u003e, and you import the library\n \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;example.com/repo/foo/bar\u003c/code\u003e, the dependency will be\n \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;//src/foo/bar:go_default_library\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOtherwise, Gazelle will use the current \u003ccode\u003eexternal\u003c/code\u003e mode to resolve\n the dependency.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ea) In \u003ccode\u003eexternal\u003c/code\u003e mode (the default), Gazelle will transform the import\n string into an external repository label. For example,\n \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;golang.org/x/sys/unix\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e would be resolved to\n \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;@org_golang_x_sys//unix:go_default_library\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e. Gazelle does not confirm\n whether the external repository is actually declared in WORKSPACE,\n but if there \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e a \u003ccode\u003ego_repository\u003c/code\u003e in WORKSPACE with a matching\n \u003ccode\u003eimportpath\u003c/code\u003e, Gazelle will use its name. Gazelle does not index\n rules in external repositories, so it's possible the resolved dependency\n does not exist.\n b) In \u003ccode\u003estatic\u003c/code\u003e mode, Gazelle has the same behavior as \u003ccode\u003eexternal\u003c/code\u003e mode,\n except that it will not call out to the network for resolution when no\n matching import is found within WORKSPACE. Instead, it will skip the\n unknown import. This is the default mode for \u003ccode\u003ego_repository\u003c/code\u003e rules.\n c) In \u003ccode\u003evendored\u003c/code\u003e mode, Gazelle will transform the import string into\n a label in the vendor directory. For example, \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;golang.org/x/sys/unix\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e\n would be resolved to\n \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;//vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix:go_default_library\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e. This mode is\n usually not necessary, since vendored libraries will be indexed and\n resolved using rule 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFix command transformations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGazelle will generate and update build files when invoked with either\n\u003ccode\u003egazelle update\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003egazelle fix\u003c/code\u003e (\u003ccode\u003eupdate\u003c/code\u003e is the default). Both commands\nperform several transformations to fix deprecated usage of the Go rules.\n\u003ccode\u003eupdate\u003c/code\u003e performs a safe set of tranformations, while \u003ccode\u003efix\u003c/code\u003e performs some\nadditional transformations that may delete or rename rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe following transformations are performed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMigrate library to embed (fix and update):\u003c/strong\u003e Gazelle replaces \u003ccode\u003elibrary\u003c/code\u003e\nattributes with \u003ccode\u003eembed\u003c/code\u003e attributes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMigrate gRPC compilers (fix and update):\u003c/strong\u003e Gazelle converts\n\u003ccode\u003ego_grpc_library\u003c/code\u003e rules to \u003ccode\u003ego_proto_library\u003c/code\u003e rules with\n\u003ccode\u003ecompilers = [\u0026quot;@io_bazel_rules_go//proto:go_grpc\u0026quot;]\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFlatten srcs (fix and update):\u003c/strong\u003e Gazelle converts \u003ccode\u003esrcs\u003c/code\u003e attributes that\nuse OS and architecture-specific \u003ccode\u003eselect\u003c/code\u003e expressions to flat lists.\nrules_go filters these sources anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSquash cgo libraries (fix only)\u003c/strong\u003e: Gazelle will remove cgo_library rules\nnamed \u003ccode\u003ecgo_default_library\u003c/code\u003e and merge their attributes with a \u003ccode\u003ego_library\u003c/code\u003e\nrule in the same package named \u003ccode\u003ego_default_library\u003c/code\u003e.

The new code must solve a problem that occurs often during the development of Bazel build rules. It is not sufficient that the new code is merely useful. Candidate code should generally have been proven to be necessary across several projects, either because it provides indispensable common functionality, or because it requires a single standardized implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs its interface simpler than its implementation? A good abstraction provides a simple interface to a complex implementation, relieving the user from the burden of understanding. By contrast, a shallow abstraction provides little that the user could not easily have written out for themselves. If a function's doc comment is longer than its body, it's a good sign that the abstraction is too shallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs its interface unimpeachable? Given the problem it tries to solve, does it have sufficient parameters or generality to address all reasonable cases, or does it make arbitrary policy choices that limit its usefulness? If the function is not general, it likely does not belong here. Conversely, if it is general thanks only to a bewildering number of parameters, it also does not belong here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it efficient? Does it solve the problem using the asymptotically optimal algorithm, without using excessive looping, allocation, or other high constant factors? Starlark is an interpreted language with relatively expensive basic operations, and an approach that might make sense in C++ may not in Starlark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf your new module meets all these criteria, then you should consider sending us a pull request.

This sets\nClosure apart from traditional JavaScript development, where terseness was\nfavored over readability, because minifiers weren't very good. Furthermore, the\nClosure Library and Templates help you follow security best practices which will\nkeep your users safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"whats-included\"\u003eWhat's Included\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosure Rules bundles the following tools and makes them \u0026quot;just work.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bazel.build/\"\u003eBazel\u003c/a\u003e: The build system Google uses to manage a repository with petabytes of\ncode.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/\"\u003eClosure Compiler\u003c/a\u003e: Type-safe, null-safe, optimizing JavaScript compiler that\ntranspiles \u003ca href=\"http://es6-features.org/\"\u003eECMASCRIPT6\u003c/a\u003e to minified ES3 JavaScript that can run in any\nbrowser.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://developers.google.com/closure/library/\"\u003eClosure Library\u003c/a\u003e: Google's core JavaScript libraries.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/\"\u003eClosure Templates\u003c/a\u003e: Type-safe HTML templating system that compiles to both\nJavaScript and Java.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Using :tool:kustomize within a Bazel project orchestrates both the preparation of the input files—for when static files won't do—and consumption of the resulting YAML document stream, situating :tool:kustomize as a transformer in the middle of that data flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e:tool:kustomize operates on the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM), and most often comes into play just ahead of Kubernetes API clients like :tool:kubectl, sending the YAML document stream to the Kubernetes API to apply the \u003ca href=\"\" title=\"link is not found\"\u003eresources\u003c/a\u003e to the cluster. These rules do no include any such interaction with the Kubernetes API. Instead, they focus solely on emitting the resources defined by the :term:kustomization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSimple Example\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere we'll walk through a simple example to give a feel for how to use these Bazel rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAssume you have a :term:kustomization that defines a single Kubernetes :krmkind:ConfigMap, taking its data entries from both a file containing \u0026quot;environment variable\u0026quot;-style line-by-line definitions and some inline definitions in the :file:kustomization.yaml file.

First, we define the kustomization \u0026lt;kustomization term_\u0026gt;kustomization \u0026lt;kustomization term_\u0026gt;kustomization \u0026lt;kustomization term_\u0026gt;\u003ca href=\"\" title=\"link is not found\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e itself, indicating where the :term:kustomization file sits and which other files it depends on. For this, we use the \u003ca href=\"\" title=\"link is not found\"\u003ekustomization\u003c/a\u003e rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eload(\n \u0026quot;@co_bisontrails_rules_kustomize//kustomize:kustomize.bzl\u0026quot;,\n \u0026quot;kustomization\u0026quot;,\n )\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003ekustomization(\n    name = \u0026quot;base\u0026quot;,\n    srcs = [\n        \u0026quot;config-bindings\u0026quot;,\n    ],\n)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy default, the \u003ca href=\"\" title=\"link is not found\"\u003ekustomization\u003c/a\u003e rule assumes the :file:kustomization file is named :file:kustomization.yaml, but you can also point it at other file names, such as the :file:kustomization.yml or :file:kustomization alternatives that the :tool:kustomize tool accepts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u0026quot;base\u0026quot; target we've defined doesn't produce any artifacts. It prepares the recipe for building artifacts, in the same way that a :term:kustomization's files are inert input for the :tool:kustomize tool. When we'd like to build the :term:kustomization using particular options—as we would by invoking :command:kustomize build—we define another target in a :file:BUILD.bazel file. Here we'll add to the same Bazel package, this time using the kustomized_resources\u003ca href=\"\" title=\"link is not found\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003ekustomized_resources(\n    name = \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot;,\n    kustomization = \u0026quot;:base\u0026quot;,\n)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we tell Bazel to build this new \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot; target, it will invoke :command:kustomize build and write the output to a file named :file:simple.yaml. That's the default mapping from target name to output file name, but you can change it with the kustomized_resources\u003ca href=\"\" title=\"link is not found\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e rule's :ruleattr:result attribute. Other Bazel targets can then demand this file as input, forcing Bazel to rebuild the file whenever—and only when—any of the input files change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eIntegrating Into Your Project\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to use these rules in your Bazel project, you must instruct Bazel to download the source and run the functions that make the rules available.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

This allows the use of the library with\nother Google projects such as glog which still use the deprecated \u0026quot;google\u0026quot;\nnamespace for the gflags library, but include it as \u0026quot;gflags/gflags.h\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"20-march-2014\"\u003e20 March 2014\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've just released gflags 2.1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe major changes are the use of CMake for the build configuration instead\nof the autotools and packaging support through CPack. The default namespace\nof all C++ symbols is now \u0026quot;gflags\u0026quot; instead of \u0026quot;google\u0026quot;.

The main\nhosting of this project remains at Google Code. Thanks to the distributed\ncharacter of Git, I can push (and pull) changes from both GitHub and Google Code\nin order to keep the two public repositories in sync.\nWhen fixing an issue for a pull request through either of these hosting\nplatforms, please reference the issue number as\n\u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/IssueTracker#Integration_with_version_control\"\u003edescribed here\u003c/a\u003e.\nFor the further development, I am following the\n\u003ca href=\"http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\"\u003eGit branching model\u003c/a\u003e\nwith feature branch names prefixed by \u0026quot;feature/\u0026quot; and bugfix branch names\nprefixed by \u0026quot;bugfix/\u0026quot;, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinary and source \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/schuhschuh/gflags/releases\"\u003epackages\u003c/a\u003e are available on GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"14-january-2014\"\u003e14 January 2014\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe migration of the build system to CMake is almost complete.\nWhat remains to be done is rewriting the tests in Python such they can be\nexecuted on non-Unix platforms and splitting them up into separate CTest tests.\nThough merging these changes into the master branch yet remains to be done,\nit is recommended to already start using the\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/schuhschuh/gflags/tree/cmake-migration\"\u003ecmake-migration\u003c/a\u003e branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"20-april-2013\"\u003e20 April 2013\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than a year has past since I (Andreas) took over the maintenance for\n\u003ccode\u003egflags\u003c/code\u003e. Only few minor changes have been made since then, much to my regret.\nTo get more involved and stimulate participation in the further\ndevelopment of the library, I moved the project source code today to\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/schuhschuh/gflags\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e.\nI believe that the strengths of \u003ca href=\"http://git-scm.com/\"\u003eGit\u003c/a\u003e will allow for better community collaboration\nas well as ease the integration of changes made by others. I encourage everyone\nwho would like to contribute to send me pull requests.\nGit's lightweight feature branches will also provide the right tool for more\nradical changes which should only be merged back into the master branch\nafter these are complete and implement the desired behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SVN repository remains accessible at Google Code and I will keep the\nmaster branch of the Git repository hosted at GitHub and the trunk of the\nSubversion repository synchronized. Initially, I was going to simply switch the\nGoogle Code project to Git, but in this case the SVN repository would be\nfrozen and force everyone who would like the latest development changes to\nuse Git as well. Therefore I decided to host the public Git repository at GitHub\ninstead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease continue to report any issues with gflags on Google Code. The GitHub project will\nonly be used to host the Git repository.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne major change of the project structure I have in mind for the next weeks\nis the migration from autotools to \u003ca href=\"http://www.cmake.org/\"\u003eCMake\u003c/a\u003e.\nCheck out the (unstable!)\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/schuhschuh/gflags/tree/cmake-migration\"\u003ecmake-migration\u003c/a\u003e\nbranch on GitHub for details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"25-january-2012\"\u003e25 January 2012\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've just released gflags 2.0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003egoogle-gflags\u003c/code\u003e project has been renamed to \u003ccode\u003egflags\u003c/code\u003e.

I've seen the energy you have\naround gflags and the ideas you have for the project going forward,\nand look forward to having you on the team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bumped the major version number up to 2 to reflect the new community\nownership of the project.  All the \u003ca href=\"ChangeLog.txt\"\u003echanges\u003c/a\u003e\nare related to the renaming.  There are no functional changes from\ngflags 1.7.  In particular, I've kept the code in the namespace\n\u003ccode\u003egoogle\u003c/code\u003e, though in a future version it should be renamed to \u003ccode\u003egflags\u003c/code\u003e.\nI've also kept the \u003ccode\u003e/usr/local/include/google/\u003c/code\u003e subdirectory as\nsynonym of \u003ccode\u003e/usr/local/include/gflags/\u003c/code\u003e, though the former name has\nbeen obsolete for some time now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"18-january-2011\"\u003e18 January 2011\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003egoogle-gflags\u003c/code\u003e Google Code page has been renamed to\n\u003ccode\u003egflags\u003c/code\u003e, in preparation for the project being renamed to\n\u003ccode\u003egflags\u003c/code\u003e.  In the coming weeks, I'll be stepping down as\nmaintainer for the gflags project, and as part of that Google is\nrelinquishing ownership of the project; it will now be entirely\ncommunity run.

This is a minor release; the major\nchange is that \u003ccode\u003eCommandLineFlagInfo\u003c/code\u003e now exports the address in memory\nwhere the flag is located.  There has also been a bugfix involving\nvery long --help strings, and some other minor \u003ca href=\"ChangeLog.txt\"\u003echanges\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"29-july-2011\"\u003e29 July 2011\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've just released gflags 1.6.  The major new feature in this release\nis support for setting version info, so that --version does something\nuseful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne minor change has required bumping the library number:\n\u003ccode\u003eReparseCommandlineFlags\u003c/code\u003e now returns \u003ccode\u003evoid\u003c/code\u003e instead of \u003ccode\u003eint\u003c/code\u003e (the int\nreturn value was always meaningless).  Though I doubt anyone ever used\nthis (meaningless) return value, technically it's a change to the ABI\nthat requires a version bump.  A bit sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere's also a procedural change with this release: I've changed the\ninternal tools used to integrate Google-supplied patches for gflags\ninto the opensource release.  These new tools should result in more\nfrequent updates with better change descriptions.  They will also\nresult in future \u003ccode\u003eChangeLog\u003c/code\u003e entries being much more verbose (for better\nor for worse).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the \u003ca href=\"ChangeLog.txt\"\u003eChangeLog\u003c/a\u003e for a full list of changes for this release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"24-january-2011\"\u003e24 January 2011\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've just released gflags 1.5.  This release has only minor changes\nfrom 1.4, including some slightly better reporting in --help, and\nan new memory-cleanup function that can help when running gflags-using\nlibraries under valgrind.  The major change is to fix up the macros\n(\u003ccode\u003eDEFINE_bool\u003c/code\u003e and the like) to work more reliably inside namespaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have not had a problem with these macros, and don't need any of\nthe other changes described, there is no need to upgrade.

This release has only minor changes\nfrom 1.3, including some documentation tweaks and some work to make\nthe library smaller.  If 1.3 is working well for you, there's no\nparticular reason to upgrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-january-2010\"\u003e4 January 2010\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've just released gflags 1.3.  gflags now compiles under MSVC, and\nall tests pass.  I \u003cstrong\u003ereally\u003c/strong\u003e never thought non-unix-y Windows folks\nwould want gflags, but at least some of them do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe major news, though, is that I've separated out the python package\ninto its own library, \u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags\"\u003epython-gflags\u003c/a\u003e.\nIf you're interested in the Python version of gflags, that's the place to\nget it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"10-september-2009\"\u003e10 September 2009\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've just released gflags 1.2.  The major change from gflags 1.1 is it\nnow compiles under MinGW (as well as cygwin), and all tests pass.  I\nnever thought Windows folks would want unix-style command-line flags,\nsince they're so different from the Windows style, but I guess I was\nwrong!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other changes are minor, such as support for --htmlxml in the\npython version of gflags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"15-april-2009\"\u003e15 April 2009\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've just released gflags 1.1.  It has only minor changes fdrom gflags\n1.0 (see the \u003ca href=\"ChangeLog.txt\"\u003eChangeLog\u003c/a\u003e for details).\nThe major change is that I moved to a new system for creating .deb and .rpm files.\nThis allows me to create x86_64 deb and rpm files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the process of moving to this new system, I noticed an\ninconsistency: the tar.gz and .rpm files created libraries named\nlibgflags.so, but the deb file created libgoogle-gflags.so.  I have\nfixed the deb file to create libraries like the others.  I'm no expert\nin debian packaging, but I believe this has caused the package name to\nchange as well.

Though the standard rules_rust\nrules can be used to compile Rust code from scratch, the fine granularity of the\ndependency ecosystem makes transforming dependency trees based on that ecosystem\nonerous, even for code with few dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"usage\"\u003eUsage\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecargo-raze can generate buildable targets in one of two modes: Vendoring, or\nNon-Vendoring. In the vendoring mode, developers use the common \u003ccode\u003ecargo vendor\u003c/code\u003e\nsubcommand to retrieve the dependencies indicated by their workspace Cargo.toml into\ndirectories that cargo-raze then populates with BUILD files. In the\nnon-vendoring mode, cargo-raze generates a flat list of BUILD files, and a\nworkspace-level macro that can be invoked in the WORKSPACE file to pull down the\ndependencies automatically in similar fashion to Cargo itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn both cases, the first step is to decide where to situate the Cargo\ndependencies in the workspace. This library was designed with monorepos in mind,\nwhere an organization decides upon a set of dependencies that everyone points\nat. It is intended that stakeholders in the dependencies collaborate to upgrade\ndependencies atomically, and fix breakages across their codebase simultaneously.\nIn the event that this isn't feasible, it is still possible to use cargo-raze in\na decentralized scenario, but it's unlikely that such decoupled repositories\nwould interact well together with the current implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of the approach chosen, the rust_rules should be brought in to the\nWORKSPACE.

Fixes can be non-trivial in a few cases, but a good number of\nthe most popular crates have been built in an example repo, available at\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/acmcarther/cargo-raze-crater\"\u003ehttps://github.com/acmcarther/cargo-raze-crater\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-repos\"\u003eExample Repos\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee these examples of providing crate configuration:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUsing vendored mode\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/google/cargo-raze/tree/main/examples/vendored/hello_cargo_library\"\u003ehello-cargo-library\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/google/cargo-raze/tree/main/examples/vendored/complicated_cargo_library\"\u003ecomplicated-cargo-library\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/google/cargo-raze/tree/main/examples/vendored/non_cratesio_library\"\u003enon-cratesio\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUsing remote mode\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/google/cargo-raze/tree/main/examples/remote/complicated_cargo_library\"\u003ecomplicated-example\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/google/cargo-raze/tree/main/examples/remote/non_cratesio\"\u003enon-cratesio\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompiling OpenSSL\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/acmcarther/compile_openssl\"\u003eopenssl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003e[package.metadata.raze]\u003c/code\u003e section is derived from a struct declared in \u003ca href=\"./impl/src/settings.rs\"\u003eimpl/src/settings.rs\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n","license":"                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

The CASE versions\nare case-insensitive. You can safely pass :cpp:nullptr pointers for this macro. They\ntreat :cpp:nullptr and any non-:cpp:nullptr string as not equal. Two :cpp:nullptr\\\ns are equal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNote that both arguments may be temporary strings which are destructed\nat the end of the current \u0026quot;full expression\u0026quot; (e.g.,\n:cpp:CHECK_STREQ(Foo().c_str(), Bar().c_str()) where \u003ccode\u003eFoo\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eBar\u003c/code\u003e\nreturn C++’s :cpp:`std::string`).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eCHECK_DOUBLE_EQ\u003c/code\u003e macro checks the equality of two floating point\nvalues, accepting a small error margin. \u003ccode\u003eCHECK_NEAR\u003c/code\u003e accepts a third\nfloating point argument, which specifies the acceptable error margin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eVerbose Logging\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you are chasing difficult bugs, thorough log messages are very useful.\nHowever, you may want to ignore too verbose messages in usual development. For\nsuch verbose logging, glog provides the \u003ccode\u003eVLOG\u003c/code\u003e macro, which allows you to\ndefine your own numeric logging levels. The :cmd:--v command line option\ncontrols which verbose messages are logged:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVLOG(1) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026quot;I’m printed when you run the program with --v=1 or higher\u0026quot;;\n VLOG(2) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026quot;I’m printed when you run the program with --v=2 or higher\u0026quot;;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith \u003ccode\u003eVLOG\u003c/code\u003e, the lower the verbose level, the more likely messages are to be\nlogged. For example, if :cmd:--v==1, \u003ccode\u003eVLOG(1)\u003c/code\u003e will log, but \u003ccode\u003eVLOG(2)\u003c/code\u003e\nwill not log. This is opposite of the severity level, where \u003ccode\u003eINFO\u003c/code\u003e is 0, and\n\u003ccode\u003eERROR\u003c/code\u003e is 2. :cmd:--minloglevel of 1 will log \u003ccode\u003eWARNING\u003c/code\u003e and above. Though\nyou can specify any integers for both \u003ccode\u003eVLOG\u003c/code\u003e macro and :cmd:--v flag, the\ncommon values for them are small positive integers. For example, if you write\n\u003ccode\u003eVLOG(0)\u003c/code\u003e, you should specify :cmd:--v=-1 or lower to silence it. This is\nless useful since we may not want verbose logs by default in most cases. The\n\u003ccode\u003eVLOG\u003c/code\u003e macros always log at the \u003ccode\u003eINFO\u003c/code\u003e log level (when they log at all).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVerbose logging can be controlled from the command line on a per-module\nbasis:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e--vmodule=mapreduce=2,file=1,gfs*=3 --v=0\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ewill:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(a) Print \u003ccode\u003eVLOG(2)\u003c/code\u003e and lower messages from mapreduce.{h,cc}\n(b) Print \u003ccode\u003eVLOG(1)\u003c/code\u003e and lower messages from file.{h,cc}\n(c) Print \u003ccode\u003eVLOG(3)\u003c/code\u003e and lower messages from files prefixed with \u0026quot;gfs\u0026quot;\n(d) Print \u003ccode\u003eVLOG(0)\u003c/code\u003e and lower messages from elsewhere\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe wildcarding functionality shown by (c) supports both ’*’ (matches 0\nor more characters) and ’?’ (matches any single character) wildcards.\nPlease also check the section about command line flags \u0026lt;#setting-flags\u0026gt;command line flags \u0026lt;#setting-flags\u0026gt;command line flags \u0026lt;#setting-flags\u0026gt;\u003ca href=\"\" title=\"link is not found\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s also \u003ccode\u003eVLOG_IS_ON(n)\u003c/code\u003e \u0026quot;verbose level\u0026quot; condition macro.

Note\nthat the keys here are different and less granular than the keys in the \u003ccode\u003eurls\u003c/code\u003e\nattribute.

One way to\ncreate a sysroot is to use \u003ccode\u003edocker export\u003c/code\u003e to get a single archive of the\nentire filesystem for the image you want.

Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License.

Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Here are\nsome examples of this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA subproject in the repo is published as a maven artifact (\u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e). Others (\u003ccode\u003eB\u003c/code\u003e) depend on this artifact (\u003ccode\u003eB -\u0026gt; A\u003c/code\u003e) and in turn we depend on those (we have added \u003ccode\u003eB\u003c/code\u003e to our dependencies file). We don't want to pull \u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e from a maven repo, since we build it internally, so we replace that artifact with an internal target.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe get some scala artifacts directly from the sdk. So, if a jar says it needs \u003ccode\u003eorg.scala-lang:scala-library\u003c/code\u003e we already have that (and a few other jars) declared, and we don't want to risk having two potentially incompatible versions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA small external project has both a bazel build and a maven publishing. We prefer to use the bazel build so we can easily pull more recent versions by bumping up a gitsha rather than waiting for jar to be published.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe replacements work on the level of artifacts. An artifact is replaced one-for-one with a local\nbazel target. For instance:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-yaml\"\u003ereplacements:\n  org.scala-lang:\n    scala-library:\n      lang: scala/unmangled # scala-library is not mangled like sbt does with other jars\n      target: \u0026quot;@io_bazel_rules_scala_scala_library\u0026quot;\n    scala-reflect:\n      lang: scala/unmangled\n      target: \u0026quot;@io_bazel_rules_scala_scala_reflect\u0026quot;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way, we redirect maven deps to those providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote, we stop walking the graph when we see a replaced node, so the replacement target is now\nresponsible for building correctly, and correctly exporting any dependencies that need to be\non the compile classpath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"code\"\u003eCode\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis code was originally forked from \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/pgr0ss/bazel-deps\"\u003epgr0ss/bazel-deps\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis code was inspired by the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/aether-demo/blob/322fa556494335faaf3ad3b7dbe8f89aaaf6222d/aether-demo-snippets/src/main/java/org/eclipse/aether/examples/GetDependencyTree.java\"\u003eaether examples\u003c/a\u003e for walking maven dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n","license":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Paul Gross\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

A library should not execute code, apart from defining symbols\nlike constants, functions and classes. One library may depend on other libraries\nliving in other source tree directories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo build a library is in essence to copy the source files into an output\ndirectory, preserving the path structure and not modifying any code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"php-binary\"\u003ePHP binary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA PHP binary is a single script file which executes PHP code, meaning it\ntakes inputs and produces outputs. An executable may depend on PHP libraries.\nThe main file should have a class with \u003ccode\u003epublic static function main($args) {}\u003c/code\u003e,\nsimilar to Java or C# and this is considered the entry point method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding an executable is achieved through copying the executable source files,\nall transitive dependencies (i.e. libraries) to their respective directories and\nalso produce a bootstrapping entry point which handles autoloading of symbols,\nincludes the executable sources and calls\n\u003ccode\u003eYourMainClass::main(array_slice($argv, 1))\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"php-test\"\u003ePHP test\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA PHP test is a library which can execute test methods from test case classes. A\ntest usually depends on at least one library or an executable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo build a PHP test is similar as to building a library, the main difference is\nwe also produce an executable file which runs all the test cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"bootstrapping\"\u003eBootstrapping\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBootstrapping a PHP target is like doing a dry-run on the source code, which\nimplies loading all the sources to try and find dependency issues before actual\nruntime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is achieved by generating an autoload function with whitelisted sources, as\nbazel does not remove files of a built target if you remove a dependency to it\nfrom another target. This holds for php_library, php_binary and php_test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen building a library, the source files are only loaded so to find any issue\nin static references outside scoped code (e.g. outside classes, such as an\nextended class). This ensures that if we, for example extend a class from an\nexternal dependency, that the base class can be autoloaded (i.e. is\nwhitelisted).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor executables and tests, the bootstrap process is the same and the autoload\nfunction generated for the executable script or test runner also has whitelisted\nsources.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

The main issue is that the\n\u003ccode\u003e{LANG}_{PROTO|GRPC}_library\u003c/code\u003e rules are \u003cstrong\u003etightly bound to a specific set of\ndependencies\u003c/strong\u003e. As such, rules_proto users are tightly bound to the specific\nlabels named by those rules. This is a problem for the maintainer as one must\nkeep the dependencies current. It is also a problem for rule consumers: \u003cem\u003eit\nbecomes increasingly difficult to upgrade as the dependencies as assumptions and\ndependencies drift\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith \u003ccode\u003estackb/rules_proto\u003c/code\u003e in its \u003ccode\u003ev2\u003c/code\u003e gazelle-based form, it is largely\n\u003cstrong\u003edependency-free\u003c/strong\u003e: other than gazelle and the \u003ccode\u003eprotoc\u003c/code\u003e toolchain, \u003cem\u003ethere are\nno dependencies that you cannot fully control in your own workspace via the\ngazelle configuration\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gazelle based design also makes things \u003cem\u003emuch\u003c/em\u003e simpler and powerful, because\nthe \u003cstrong\u003econtent of the proto files is the source of truth\u003c/strong\u003e. Due to the fact that\nBazel does not permit reading/interpreting a file during the scope of an action,\nit is impossible to make a decision about what to do. A prime example of this is\nthe \u003ccode\u003ego_package\u003c/code\u003e option. If the \u003ccode\u003ego_package\u003c/code\u003e option is present, the location of\nthe output file for \u003ccode\u003eprotoc-gen-go\u003c/code\u003e is completely different. As a result, the\ninformation about the go_package metadata ultimately needs to be duplicated so\nthat the build system can know about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gazelle-based approach moves all that messy interpretation and evaluation\ninto a precompiled state; as a result, the work that needs to be done in the\naction itself is dramatically simplified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, by parsing the proto files it is easy to support complex custom\nplugins that do things like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmit no files (only assert/lint).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmit a file only if a specific enum constant is found. With the previous\ndesign, this was near impossible.

Unfortunately, Bazel doesn't understand requirements.txt files and only\nunderstands the concept of a \u003ccode\u003epy_library\u003c/code\u003e; which is one or more Python source files. This library\naims to bridge that gap. The rules_pygen generator takes a requirements.txt file as an input and\ngenerates a dependency graph of \u003ccode\u003epy_library\u003c/code\u003e rules based on the dependencies and subdependencies\nthat pip would install given that requirements.txt file. In cases where a dependency is\nplatform-specific, this tool generates two variants, one for MacOS and another for Linux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common way to use this script is in a monorepo where one requirements.txt defines all the\nPython dependencies in your project, though you could potentially have more than one requirements\nfile and run the script multiple times. Each time you change your requirements.txt (to add/modify\na dependency) you re-run this script manually to generate the requirements.bzl variant which Bazel\nunderstands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"limitations\"\u003eLimitations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe script itself runs on Python3.5+\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnly works with wheels right now\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes not work on Windows\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConfig settings for linux / macos are assumed to live at //tool_bazel\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"usage--set-up\"\u003eUsage \u0026amp;

Run `npm adduser \u0026lt;repo_url\u0026gt;` (example: `npm adduser --registry=https://repo.vaticle.com/repository/npm-private`)\n2. When prompted, provide login credentials to sign in to the user account that is used in your CI and has permissions to publish the package\n3. If successful, a line will be added to your `.npmrc` file (`$HOME/.npmrc` on Unix) which looks like: `//repo.vaticle.com/repository/npm-snapshot/:_authToken=NpmToken.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`. The token is the value of `_authToken`, in this case `NpmToken.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.\n4. Save the auth token somewhere safe and then delete it from your `.npmrc` file\n\n### Using a UI\n\nSome remote repository managers (e.g. the `npm` registry, https://npmjs.com) provide a UI to create auth tokens.\n\n#### `npm` registry (`npmjs.com`)\n\n1. Sign in to the user account at https://npmjs.com that is used in your CI and has permissions to publish the package\n2. Navigate to the account's \u0026quot;Access Tokens\u0026quot;, generate a new one and store it somewhere

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

However, the \u003ccode\u003e-\u003c/code\u003e character (and perhaps\nothers) is not allowed in external names with Bazel, so they will be replaced\nwith a \u003ccode\u003e.\u003c/code\u003e.

We tried to\nhand-tailor our own BUILD files, but this quickly became a monumental task. At first, we collected files from the each\ndirectory into a \u003ccode\u003epython_shared_library\u003c/code\u003e target (mirroring gazelle's \u003ccode\u003ego_default_library\u003c/code\u003e) and all\n\u003ccode\u003epython_shared_library\u003c/code\u003e targets into a top-level \u003ccode\u003epython_main_library\u003c/code\u003e target. This target was added as a dependency to\neach test file. This worked for the first 3-4 tests, but failed spectacularly for the remaining tests when we ran out of\ninodes on ext4-based filesystems. Because bazel symlinks all test dependencies into the runfiles tree, so far the build\nconsumed upward of 7 \u003cem\u003emillion\u003c/em\u003e inodes. We considered 1.) switching filesystems or 2.) sandboxfs, but found that 1.) put\ntoo much of a burden on Linux-based developers, and 2.) didn't work for us as expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe realized that we needed to automate the process of parsing Python source code, which would allow us manage\ndependencies in a fine-grained manner to eliminate the inode problem.\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woma_python\"\u003eRamsay\u003c/a\u003e is the result of this effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"license\"\u003eLicense\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\"\u003eBSD-3-Clause\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","license":"Copyright (c) 2018- Zenreach, Inc.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n-Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n-Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this\n list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or\n other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n-Neither the name of the project nor the names of its contributors may\n be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without\n specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
